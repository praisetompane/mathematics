    1.
        To prove a proposition(p) is True:
            choose axioms and use theorem
            follow logical deductions
            reach conclusion that p is True


    2.
        proof by contradiction:
            To prove a proposition(P) is True(T):
                assume P is False(F)(i.e ̸P is T  = not P is T)
                then use that hypothesis(i.e P is F), to derive a falsehood or a contradiction
            Works because:
                if /P => F is True
                    for /P => F to be True
                    {/P must be F}
                        ∴ P is T
            examples:
                p = √2 is irrational
                    pf (by contradiction)
                        assume P is False => therefore assume for purpose contradiction that √2 is rational
                            ∴ √2 can be expressed as a/b, where a/b is a fraction of lowest terms(i.e. a and b have no common divisor).

                                                            √2 = a/b
                            square both sides            => 2 = a²/b²
                            multiply both sides by b²    => 2 * b² = a²/b² * b²/1
                                                            2b² = a²b²/b²
                                                            2b² = a² * 1
                                                            2b² = a²

                                                - 2b² is even (because any number multiplied by 2 is even)
                                                    - ∴ a² is even (because 2b² = a² )
                                                        - ∴ a is even
                                                            (even number squared produces an even number and odd number sqaured produces odd number)
                                                            ∴ (2 | a): 2 divides a : [| = divides symbol]
                                                        - ∴ (4 | a²), because even numbers start at 2, a² >= 4
                                                            NB: a² is a muliple of of 4
                                                            ∴ (4 | 2b²), because 2b² = a²
                                                                - divide both sides by 2: (4\2 | 2b²\2) = (2 | b²)
                                                                    ∴ b is even, because its b² is divisible by 2, and even number squared produces an even number.

                                                                    ∴ a\b is NOT in lowest terms, contradictory to √2 = a/b, where a\ is a fraction in lowest terms.
