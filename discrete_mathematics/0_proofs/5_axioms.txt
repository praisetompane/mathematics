def: a proposition that is assumed to be True (Leighton, 2010).
    NB: There is no proof it is True
        Greek etymology := to think worth
        ∴ Something we deem worthy to be True

properties of a set of axioms(Leighton, 2010):
    consistent
    complete

    f(P) = R = T|F
        f := set of axioms
        P := proposition
        R := result(truth value)

    def: consistent := no proposition can be proved to be BOTH True AND False

    def: complete := can be used to prove that every proposition is either True OR False

    NB: Gödel's incompleteness theorems
        There is NO set of axioms that is BOTH consistent AND complete

        consistentency is a MUST, something cannot be BOTH True AND False
        ∴ if we want consistentency in a given set of axioms, 
            there will be True facts that we will never be able to prove True or False

the axiomatic method (Meyer, Chlipala, 2015):
    1. define axioms
    2. prove other propositions from step 1 axioms

    Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice Axioms(ZFC) + logical deduction rules ≈ drive all of mathematics(Meyer, Chlipala, 2015).
