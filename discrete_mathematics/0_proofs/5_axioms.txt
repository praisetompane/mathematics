def: a proposition that is assumed to be True
    NB: There is no proof it is True
        Greek etymology := to think worth
        ∴ Something we deem worthy to be True

properties of a set of axioms:
    consistent
    complete

    f(P) = R = T|F
        f := set of axioms
        P := proposition
        R := result(truth value)

def: consistent := no proposition can be proved to be BOTH True AND False

def: complete := can be used to prove that every proposition is either True OR False

NB: Gödel's incompleteness theorems
    There is NO set of axioms that is BOTH consistent AND complete

    consistentency is a MUST, something cannot be BOTH True AND False
    ∴ if we want consistentency in a given set of axioms, 
        there will be True facts that we will never be able to prove True or False
