def adjacency: two nodes xᵢ, xⱼ are adjacent 
                    if {xᵢ, xⱼ} ∈ E (Prof. Tom Leighton, Dr. Marten van Dijk, 2010).
                i.e. xᵢ, xⱼ are connected by an edge
                ∴ {xᵢ, xⱼ} is an edge
                    a member of set E

def incidence: an edge e = {xᵢ, xⱼ} is incident 
                    to its endpoints xᵢ and xⱼ (Prof. Tom Leighton, Dr. Marten van Dijk, 2010).
            ∴ e is incident xᵢ
            ∴ e is incident xⱼ

def degree: number of edges incident to a node/vertex
                is the degree of node/vertex (Prof. Tom Leighton, Dr. Marten van Dijk, 2010).
            
            in 0_def.txt example:
                deg(x₂) = 2
                i.e. there are two egdes connected to x₂
