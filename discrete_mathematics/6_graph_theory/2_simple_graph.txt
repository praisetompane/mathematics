def: a graph without loops and multiedges (Leighton, van Dijk, 2010).
    loop: edge e | e = {x₁, x₁}
    multiedge:  E = {
                        {x₁,x₂},
                        {x₂,x₁}
                    }
            i.e. 2 different egdes connecting same vertices

def max_edges: n(n - 1)/2
    n = number of members
    (n - 1) = the universe of members that can be paired with 
    since we disallow multiedges, we remove the duplicate pairings. hence  division by 2
