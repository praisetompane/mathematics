# What is Mathematics?

objective: an attempt at unpacking in layman's terms what mathematics is and how it is created.

def¹: mathematics is an art like music and painting (Lockhart, 2009: 3).

def²: mathematics is about pure reason to get at the truth about something (Lockhart, 2009: 4).

plain english:
- def: mathematics is a formal language. this means it has precise definitions for its words(+,-,\*, π,e, etc) and grammar.
- the symbols are merely shorthands.
     symbols such as `∧`, `Σ`, `∀`, `+`, `×`.
     - `∧` means: AND
     - `Σ` means: sum
     - `∀` means: for all
     - `+` means: add[which you know from Grade 1 Mathematics]
     - `-` means: subtract[which you know from Grade 1 Mathematics]

def: how is it created?:
- [initialize mathematics from natural numbers](0_foundations/numbers/foundations_of_mathematics_natural_numbers_basis.txt)
- [initialize mathematics from axiomatic method](0_foundations/foundations_of_mathematics_axiomatic_basis.txt)
