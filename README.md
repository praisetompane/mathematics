# Mathematics Branches:

* Pure Mathematics: studies basic concepts and structures that underlie mathematics (MIT Mathematics).
    * foundations
    * geometry
    * algebra
    * analysis

    * foundations: studies the formulation and analysis 
                    of the language, 
                    axioms 
                    logical methods
                on which all Mathematics is built/rests.
        * Logic and Model theory
        * Computability Theory and Recursion theory
        * Set Theory
        * Category Theory
        
    * geometry: studies concepts such as space, area and volume.
        * Euclidean Geometry
        * Non-euclidean Geometry
        * Absolute Geometry
        * Metric Geometry
        * Projective Geometry
