# What is Mathematics?
![build status](https://github.com/praisetompane/mathematics/actions/workflows/mathematics.yaml/badge.svg) <br>

**objective**: an attempt at unpacking in layman's terms what mathematics is and how it is created.

**def mathematics¹**: is an art like music and painting (Lockhart, 2009: 3).

**def mathematics²**: is about pure reason to get at the truth about something (Lockhart, 2009: 4).

**plain english**:
- **def mathematics:** is a formal language. this means it has precise definitions for its words(+,-,\*, π,e, etc) and grammar.
- the symbols are merely shorthands.
     symbols such as `∧`, `Σ`, `∀`, `+`, `×`.
     - `∧` means: AND
     - `Σ` means: sum
     - `∀` means: for all
     - `+` means: add[which you know from Grade 1 Mathematics]
     - `-` means: subtract[which you know from Grade 1 Mathematics]

**def how is it created?**:
