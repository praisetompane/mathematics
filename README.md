# What is Mathematics?
![build status](https://github.com/praisetompane/mathematics/actions/workflows/mathematics.yaml/badge.svg) <br>

## Objectives
- An attempt at unpacking in layman's terms what mathematics is and how it is created.

## Definitions
- def mathematics¹(Lockhart, 2009: 3): is an art like music and painting.

- def mathematics²(Lockhart, 2009: 4): is about pure reason to get at the truth about something.

- def mathematics: is a formal language. this means it has precise definitions for its words(+,-,\*, π,e, etc) and grammar.
- the symbols are merely shorthands.
     symbols such as `∧`, `Σ`, `∀`, `+`, `×`.
     - `∧` means: AND
     - `Σ` means: sum
     - `∀` means: for all
     - `+` means: add[which you know from Grade 1 Mathematics]
     - `-` means: subtract[which you know from Grade 1 Mathematics]

- def side of Mathematics:(Hammack, 2018:viii):
     - computation focused:
          - primary goals:
               - solve equations.
               - compute derivatives.
               - compute integrals.
               - multiply matrices.
               - find determinants.
               - ...
               - use the above-mentioned computations to answer practical questions about the real world.

          **NB:** Mathematical techniques and procedures used in this side, are founded in the theoretical side.
     - theoretical focused:
          - primary goals:
               - understand Mathematical structures.
               - prove Mathematical statements.
               - invent or discover new Mathematical theorems and theories.

- def how is it created:
     - [initialize mathematics from natural numbers](03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/foundations_numbers_method.txt)
     - [initialize mathematics from axiomatic method](03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/foundations_axiomatic_method.txt)
