## Objectives
- An attempt at unpacking Mathematics and its creation/discovery in layman's terms.

## Definitions

- def mathematics¹ (Lockhart, 2009: 3): an art like music and painting.

- def mathematics²(Devlin, 2012:15): the science of patterns.
     - examples:
          - Logic                            = patterns of reasoning.
          - Arithmetic and Number Theory     = patterns of number and counting.
          - Geometry                         = patterns of shape.
          - Calculus                         = patterns of motion.
          - Topology                         = patterns of closeness and position.
          - Probability Theory               = patterns of chance.

- def mathematics³(Kuber, 2024): a collection of subjects/branches/theories in which each subject/branch/theory is a formal system.
  - see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/1_formal_system.txt

- def mathematics⁴(Wildberger, 2011): mathematics is common sense, precise use of language, and logical reasoning, applied to the study of patterns and problem solving.

- def sides | perspectives of Mathematics:(Hammack, 2018:viii):
     - computation focused: use the below-mentioned computations to answer practical questions about the world.
          - primary goals:
               - solve equations.
               - compute derivatives.
               - compute integrals.
               - multiply matrices.
               - find determinants.
               - ...
          **NB:** Mathematical techniques and procedures used in this side, are founded in the theoretical side.

     - theoretical focused:
          - primary goals:
               - understand Mathematical structures.
               - prove Mathematical statements.
               - invent or discover new Mathematical theorems or theories.
               - use Mathematics to study itself.
               - ...
