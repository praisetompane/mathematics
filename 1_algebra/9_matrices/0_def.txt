def¹: a chart of elments 
        arranged in
            rows and columns (Censor, 2015):

    example:
        A = ( 
              1  0 π 
              √2 𝑖 -3    
            )

        A is a matrix over ℂ

    
    general form:
        A = (
              a₁₁ a₁₂ a₁₃ ... a₁ₙ
              a₂₁ a₂₂ a₂₃ ... a₂ₙ
              a₃₁ a₃₂ a₃₃ ... a₃ₙ
              .    .   .       .
              .    .   .       .
              .    .   .       .
              aₘ₁  aₘ₂ aₘ₃ ...  aₘₙ 
            )

        NB: MYINC: the columns are fixed forall m in the general form.
            Q: Is this an interesting property?
        
        notation:
            - aᵢⱼ is the entry in:
                - row i
                - column j
                of the matrix
            - A = Aₘₓₙ = (aᵢⱼ)
                - matrix A has m rows AND n columns
            - A ∈ Mₘₓₙ(ℂ)
                - Mₘₓₙ = family of m × n matrices
                - Mₘₓₙ(ℂ) = family of m × n matrices over the Complex Numbers
                ∴ A ∈ Mₘₓₙ(ℂ) = A is a member of m × n matrices over the Complex Numbers
            - if m = n, then
                A ∈ Mₙ(ℂ)
                - Mₙ = shorthand for Mₙₓₙ

            - concepts:
                - size of matrix: m × n
                    - m = number of rows
                    - n = number of columns
                - square matrix: A = Aₙₓₙ
                - main diagonal: all elements aᵢᵢ
                    NB: i AND j = same value
                        example:
                            given A = A₃ₓ₃
                            main diagonal = a₁₁, a₂₂, a₃₃ 
                    NB: usually only associated with square matrices
                            because row AND column numbers are equal
                                therefore a full diagonal form
                                    a₁₁ to aᵢᵢ is possible
                            NB: in a rectangular matrix, this is not possible,
                                    eventually we reach an entry aₘₙ where,
                                        n > m
                                        example:
                                            in A = A₂ₓ₃
