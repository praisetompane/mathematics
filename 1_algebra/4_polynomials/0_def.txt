def terms: parts of an algebraic expression, operated on by + or-.(Q: only + or -?)
    Examples:
        4xz + 3x - 3 => 3 terms
        4x³y - 3y² => 2 terms

def polynomial: 
    algebraic expression with more than one term.
    poly = many
    nomial = part(Terms in the context of algebraic expressions)

    types:
        - 1 term = monomial
        - 2 terms = binomial
        - 3 terms = trinomial
        - higher number of terms

        - 1 term = monomial
            Examples:
                7
                4x² 
                5xy⁴
        - 2 terms = binomial
            Examples:
                4x - 7
                3xy + 4x
        - 3 terms = trinomial
            Examples:
                3 + a + b
                3cd + a + 8
        - higher number of terms
            Examples:
                8x + a + b + c
                9y - a - b + c + x²
