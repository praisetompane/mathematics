A pair of a set G and an operation ◦ (G, ◦), is a group if
    it satisfies the axioms below (Censor, 2015):

axioms (Censor, 2015):
    - closure: ∀ a,b ∈ G, a◦b ∈ G
        for any elements a and b of G
            the results of applying operation ◦ 
                on a and b 
                    is an element of G

    - associativity: ∀ a,b,c, (a◦b)◦c = a◦(b◦c)
        for any elements a,b and c of G
            the order of applying operation ◦
                on a,b and c produces 
                    the same result

    - identity: ∃ e ∈ G such that ∀ a ∈ G, a ◦ e = a
        for any element a of G
            there exists an element e of G
                such that when operation ◦ is applied to a and e
                    the result is a

    - inverse: ∀ a ∈ G, ∃ b ∈ G, such that a ◦ b = e
        for any element a of G
            there exists an b of G
                such that when operation ◦ is applied to a and b
                    the result is e(i.e. the identity of the group G)

def Abelian or commutative group:
    group (G,◦) is commutative/albian
        if it satisfies the axiom below:

    axiom:
        commutativity:  ∀a,b, a◦b = b◦a
            for any element a and b of G
                swapping a and b order
                    when applying operation ◦
                        produces the same result
