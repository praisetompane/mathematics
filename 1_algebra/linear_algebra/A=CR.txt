types:
    - columns and rows in the same direction
    - rank 2 matrix
    - symmetric matrix
    - orthogonal matrix (pependicular)

    - columns and rows in the same direction:
        Example:
            A₀ = [ 1 3  2
                    4 12 8
                    2 6  4 ]
            
                row_2 = 4 * row_1. NB: Is it just row 1 scaled by 4
                        = 2 * row_3. NB: Is it just row 3 scaled by 2
                row_3 = 2 * row_1. NB: Is it just row 1 scaled by 2
                
                NB: The "vectors" are pointing in the same direction.
                    They just have different magnitude(length)

                col_2 = 3 * col_1. NB: Is it just col 1 scaled by 3
                col_3 = 2 * col_1. NB: It is just col 1 scaled by 2

                OBSERVATION⁴:
                    When the rows are in the same direction, the columns are too.

    - orthogonal matrix (pependicular):
        expresses rotation of the plane.
