def¹ group: a pair of a set G and an operation ◦ (G, ◦), is a group if
    it satisfies the axioms below (Censor, 2015).

def² group: a 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 (G, ∘) for the axioms 𝐺𝑃 = {γ₁, γ₂, γ₃, γ₄} (Kunen, 2007:5).

𝐺𝑃: axioms (Censor, 2015):
    - γ₁:  closure: ∀ a,b ∈ G, a◦b ∈ G
                for any elements a and b of G
                    the results of applying operation ◦ 
                        on a and b 
                            is an element of G

    - γ₂: associativity: ∀ a,b,c, (a◦b)◦c = a◦(b◦c)
                for any elements a,b and c of G
                    the order of applying operation ◦
                        on a,b and c produces 
                            the same result

    - γ₃: identity: ∃ e ∈ G such that ∀ a ∈ G, a ◦ e = a
                for any element a of G
                    there exists an element e of G
                        such that when operation ◦ is applied to a and e
                            the result is a

    - γ₄: inverse: ∀ a ∈ G, ∃ b ∈ G, such that a ◦ b = e
                for any element a of G
                    there exists an b of G
                        such that when operation ◦ is applied to a and b
                            the result is e(i.e. the identity of the group G)

def Abelian or commutative group:
    group (G,◦) is commutative/Abelian
        if it satisfies the Group definition axiom and axiom below (Censor, 2015):

    axiom:
        commutativity:  ∀a,b, a◦b = b◦a
            for any element a and b of G
                swapping a and b order
                    when applying operation ◦
                        produces the same result
