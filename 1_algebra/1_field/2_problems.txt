(ℚ, +):
    closure: 2/3 + 1/2  = 4/6 + 3/6 = 7/6 ∈ ℚ
    associativity: (2/3 + 1/2) + 4/5 = 2/3 + (1/2 + 4/5)
                   (4/6 + 3/6) + 4/5 = 2/3 + (5/10 + 8/10)
                   7/6 + 4/5         = 2/3 + 13/10
                   35/30 + 24/30     = 20/30 + 39/30
                   59/30             = 59/30
