theorem 1 (Censor, 2015):
    let F be a Field.
        Then:
            - 0 is unique
                there can only be one value
                    playing the role of zero (i.e. additive identity).
            - 1 is unique
            - -a is unique
            - a⁻¹ is unique
            - a × -1 = -a
            - a × 0 = 0
            - ∀ab ∈ F, if a × b = 0 then a = 0 ∨ b = 0
                there are no zero divisors in a Field
            - if a + b = a + c, then b = c
                cancellation with respect to addition.
            - if a × b = a × c, then b = c (a ≠ 0)
                cancellation with respect to multiplication.

    proofs:
        - 0 is unique:
            formal (Censor, 2015):
                suppose there are two zero elements: 0 and 0^.
                
                axiom      by identity    by commutativity  by identity 
                        0^ = 0^ + 0       = 0 + 0^          = 0
                        
                        0^ = 0
                        ∴ 0 is unique

            plain english:
                suppose there are two zero elements: 0 and 0^.

                i.e. two elements playing the zero role(the additive identity).

                then:
                    for '0' playing zero role:
                                add 0 to 0^
                                
                        axiom           by additive identity axiom         
                                0^ + 0 = 0^                
                    
                    for '0^' playing zero role:
                                add 0^ to 0
                                
                        axiom           by additive identity axiom
                                0 + 0^ = 0

                    both equations above are equal

                        axiom           by commutativity axiom
                                0^ + 0 = 0 + 0^

                    ∴ 0^ = 0

                    i.e. the same, therefore can only be one zero.

                    Q: Why is it sufficient to use only two zero elements?
