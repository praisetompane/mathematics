theorem 1 (Censor, 2015):
    Let F be a Field.
    Then:
        1: 0 is unique, 1 is unique
            there can only be one value
                playing the role of zero (i.e. additive identity).
        2: -a is unique, a⁻¹ is unique
        3: a × 0 = 0
        4: ∀ab ∈ F, if a × b = 0 then a = 0 ∨ b = 0
            in words:
                for a and b in F
                    if the expression "a × b" is equal to zero
                    then either a or b is zero

            i.e. there are no zero divisors in a Field
                NB: There are structures in which this is not true. 
                    non zero values can multiple to zero
        5: a × -1 = -a
        6: if a + b = a + c, then b = c
                cancellation with respect to addition.
            if a × b = a × c, then b = c (a ≠ 0)
                cancellation with respect to multiplication.

    proofs:
        1: 0 is unique:
            formal (Censor, 2015):
                suppose there are two zero elements: 0 and 0^.
                
                axiom      by identity    by commutativity  by identity 
                        0^ = 0^ + 0       = 0 + 0^          = 0
                        
                        0^ = 0
                        ∴ 0 is unique

            plain english:
                suppose there are two zero elements: 0 and 0^.

                i.e. two elements playing the zero role(the additive identity).

                then:
                    for '0' playing zero role:
                                add 0 to 0^
                                
                        axiom           by additive identity axiom         
                                0^ + 0 = 0^                
                    
                    for '0^' playing zero role:
                                add 0^ to 0
                                
                        axiom           by additive identity axiom
                                0 + 0^ = 0

                    both equations above are equal

                        axiom           by commutativity axiom
                                0^ + 0 = 0 + 0^

                    ∴ 0^ = 0

                    i.e. the same, therefore can only be one zero.

                    Q: Why is it sufficient to use only two zero elements?

        3: a × 0 = 0:
            formal:

            plain english:
                apply identity axiom with respect to addition(+) to 0 in 𝑎 × 0 = 0:
                    then 
                        𝑎 × 0 = 0 rewrites to 𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0 + 0 
                
                apply identity axiom with respect to addition(+) to 0 + 0 on RHS:
                    then
                        𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0 + 0 rewrites to 𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0

                Then
                    𝑎 × 0 = 0 AND 𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0
                    ∴ 𝑎 × 0 = 𝑎 × (0 + 0) 
                        NB: since they both equal 0

                apply distributive axiom to 𝑎 × (0 + 0):
                    then 
                        𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0
                    ∴ 𝑎 × 0 = 𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0
 
                apply additive inverse axiom to 𝑎 × 0:
                    then 
                        𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 0
                            ∴ additive inverse is -(𝑎 × 0)
                    then 
                        rewrite 𝑎 × 0 in 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) to (𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0) [because after applying distributive axiom we showed this is true]
                            ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = (𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0) + (-(𝑎 × 0))
                
                apply associativity with respect to addition(+) to RHS
                    ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 𝑎 × 0 + (𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)))

                apply number + its inverse = 0 to LHS and RHS
                    apply to RHS (𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0))):
                        ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 𝑎 × 0 + 0 
                        ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 𝑎 × 0 

                    apply to LHS 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)):
                        ∴ 0  = 𝑎 × 0

                Then
                    0  = 𝑎 × 0 ⟹ 𝑎 × 0 = 0

        4: ∀ab ∈ F, if a × b = 0 then a = 0 ∨ b = 0:

            formal (Censor, 2015):
            
            plain english:
                Let a × b = 0
                Then:
                    if a = 0, 
                        then statement 4 is true.
                    if a ≠ 0
                        apply axiom 4 to a, 
                            then ∃a⁻¹ (i.e. there exists a multiplicative inverse for a, which is a⁻¹)
                            ∴ (a⁻¹)(a × b) is a valid statement


                        apply the assumption "Let a × b = 0" to "(a⁻¹)(a × b)"
                            then 
                                (a⁻¹)(a × b) = (a⁻¹)(0) [since (a × b) = 0 ]
                                apply statement 3(proved above) to "(a⁻¹)(0)"
                                    then
                                        (a⁻¹)(a × b) = (a⁻¹)(0) rewrites to (a⁻¹)(a × b) = 0
                                        ∴ (a⁻¹)(a × b) = 0
                        
                        apply axiom 10 to "(a⁻¹)(a × b)" of "(a⁻¹)(a × b) = 0"
                            then
                                (a⁻¹)(a × b) = 0 rewrites to (a⁻¹ × a) × b = 0
                                apply axiom 9 to "(a⁻¹ × a)" of "(a⁻¹ × a) × b = 0"
                                    then 
                                        (a⁻¹ × a) × b = 0 rewrites to 1 × b = 0
                                        ∴ b = 0
                        
                        ∴ if a ≠ 0 then b = 0
                        
                    ∴ either a = 0 ∨ b = 0
                        if a × b = 0
