theorem 1 (Censor, 2015):
    let F be a Field.
        Then:
            - 0 is unique
                there can only be one value
                    playing the role of zero (i.e. additive identity).
            - 1 is unique
            - -a is unique
            - a⁻¹ is unique
            - a × -1 = -a
            - a × 0 = 0
            - ∀ab ∈ F, if a × b = 0 then a = 0 ∨ b = 0
                there are no zero divisors in a Field
            - if a + b = a + c, then b = c
                cancellation with respect to addition.
            - if a × b = a × c, then b = c (a ≠ 0)
                cancellation with respect to multiplication.

    proofs:
        - 0 is unique:
            formal (Censor, 2015):
                suppose there are two zero elements: 0 and 0^.
                
                axiom      by identity    by commutativity  by identity 
                        0^ = 0^ + 0       = 0 + 0^          = 0
                        
                        0^ = 0
                        ∴ 0 is unique

            plain english:
                suppose there are two zero elements: 0 and 0^.

                i.e. two elements playing the zero role(the additive identity).

                then:
                    for '0' playing zero role:
                                add 0 to 0^
                                
                        axiom           by additive identity axiom         
                                0^ + 0 = 0^                
                    
                    for '0^' playing zero role:
                                add 0^ to 0
                                
                        axiom           by additive identity axiom
                                0 + 0^ = 0

                    both equations above are equal

                        axiom           by commutativity axiom
                                0^ + 0 = 0 + 0^

                    ∴ 0^ = 0

                    i.e. the same, therefore can only be one zero.

                    Q: Why is it sufficient to use only two zero elements?

        - a × 0 = 0:
            formal:

            plain english:
                apply identity axiom with respect to addition(+) to 0 in 𝑎 × 0 = 0:
                    then 
                        𝑎 × 0 = 0 rewrites to 𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0 + 0 
                
                apply identity axiom with respect to addition(+) to 0 + 0 on RHS:
                    then
                        𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0 + 0 rewrites to 𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0

                Then
                    𝑎 × 0 = 0 AND 𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0
                    ∴ 𝑎 × 0 = 𝑎 × (0 + 0) 
                        NB: since they both equal 0

                apply distributive axiom to 𝑎 × (0 + 0):
                    then 
                        𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0
                    ∴ 𝑎 × 0 = 𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0
 
                apply additive inverse axiom to 𝑎 × 0:
                    then 
                        𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 0
                            ∴ additive inverse is -(𝑎 × 0)
                    then 
                        rewrite 𝑎 × 0 in 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) to (𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0) [because after applying distributive axiom we showed this is true]
                            ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = (𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0) + (-(𝑎 × 0))
                
                apply associativity with respect to addition(+) to RHS
                    ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 𝑎 × 0 + (𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)))

                apply number + its inverse = 0 to LHS and RHS
                    apply to RHS (𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0))):
                        ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 𝑎 × 0 + 0 
                        ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 𝑎 × 0 

                    apply to LHS 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)):
                        ∴ 0  = 𝑎 × 0

                Then
                    0  = 𝑎 × 0 ⟹ 𝑎 × 0 = 0
