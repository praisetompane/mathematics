def field: a set F with two operations + and ×,  (F, +, ×), is a field if it satisfies the axioms below(Censor, 2015):

axioms (Censor, 2015):
    F with respect to addition (F, +) is a commutative group.
    F with respect to multiplication (F, ×) is a commutative group.
    + and × are related by distributivity

    (F, +) satisfies:
        closure: ∀ab ∈ F, a+b ∈ F
        associativity: ∀abc ∈ F, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
        identity: ∃0 ∈ F such that ∀a ∈ F, a + 0 = a
        inverse: ∀a ∈ F, ∃(-a) ∈ F such that a + (-a) = 0 = identity
        commutativity: ∀ab ∈ F, a+b = b+a
    
    (F, ×) satisfies:
        closure: ∀ab ∈ F, a×b ∈ F
        associativity: ∀abc ∈ F, (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)
        identity: ∃1 ∈ F such that  ∀a ∈ F, a × 1 = a
        inverse: ∀a ∈ F, a≠0, ∃a⁻¹ ∈ F such that a × a⁻¹ = 1 = identity
        commutativity: ∀ab ∈ F, a × b = ba
    
    + and × are distributive:
        ∀abc ∈ F, a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c)

special Fields (Censor, 2015):
    - a set with one element is a field.
        example: {0} is a Field.
        NB: it has no interesting characteristics.
            Therefore the convention in Mathematics is 
                the Set must have at least two different elements
                    playing the role of zero and one
                to be considered a Field.

    - Zₙ(Finite Fields): 
        - Fields with finite members(n).
            - n is prime
                i.e. number of members is prime.
                    NB: There exists ones which this is False.
        - + and × are called
            addition modulo n
            multiplication modulo n
            example:
                Z₅: Z sub 5
                    - addition modulo 5
                    - multiplication modulo 5
