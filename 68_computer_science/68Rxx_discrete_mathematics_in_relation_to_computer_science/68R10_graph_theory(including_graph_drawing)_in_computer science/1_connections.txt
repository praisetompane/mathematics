            let:
                𝑉 be nonempty set of items called vertices/nodes.
                𝐸 be a set of 2-item sets, which are subsets of 𝑉 called edges
            then:
                two nodes 𝑥ᵢ, 𝑥ⱼ  are adjacent, if {𝑥ᵢ, 𝑥ⱼ} ∈ 𝐸.

def incidence(Leighton, van Dijk, 2010):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: an edge 𝑒 = {𝑥ᵢ, 𝑥ⱼ} is incident to its endpoints 𝑥ᵢ and 𝑥ⱼ.
            ∴ 𝑒 is incident 𝑥ᵢ
            ∴ 𝑒 is incident 𝑥ⱼ
