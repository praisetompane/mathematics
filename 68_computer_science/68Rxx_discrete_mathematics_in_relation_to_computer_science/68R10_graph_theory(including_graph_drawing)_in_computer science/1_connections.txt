def adjacency: 
    - formal: ???

        - in words:
            two nodes xᵢ, xⱼ are adjacent, 
                if {xᵢ, xⱼ} ∈ E (Leighton, van Dijk, 2010).
            i.e. xᵢ, xⱼ are connected by an edge
            ∴ {xᵢ, xⱼ} is an edge
                a member of set E

def incidence: 
    - formal: ???
        - in words:
            an edge e = {xᵢ, xⱼ} is incident to its endpoints xᵢ and xⱼ (Leighton, van Dijk, 2010).
            ∴ e is incident xᵢ
            ∴ e is incident xⱼ
