def bipartite graph(Epp, 2010:641):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: a simple graph
                        whose vertex set can be partitioned into:
                            two disjoint and non-empty subsets of V₁ and V₂
                        such that:
                            - vertices in V₁ may be connected to vertices in V₂. 
                                Q: Is it at least one connection or can there be a V₁ member with no connection?
                            - no vertices in V₁ are connected to other vertices in V₁.
                            - no vertices in V₂ are connected to other vertices in V₂.
