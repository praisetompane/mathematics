def simple graph: a graph without loops and multi edges (Leighton, van Dijk, 2010).
    def loop: E = {x₁, x₁}
    def multi edge: E = {{𝑥₁,𝑥₂}, {𝑥₂,𝑥₁}}
                    i.e. 2 different edges connecting same vertices

def max_edges:
    - formal: 
        max_edges = 𝑛(𝑛 - 1)/2, where:
            - 𝑛 = number of members.
            - (𝑛 - 1) = the universe of members that can be paired with. 
            - /2 = we disallow multi edges, we remove the duplicate pairings. hence division by 2
