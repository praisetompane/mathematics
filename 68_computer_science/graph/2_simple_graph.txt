def simple graph: a graph without loops and multi edges (Leighton, van Dijk, 2010).
    def loop: E = {x₁, x₁}
    def multi edge: E = {{𝑥₁,𝑥₂}, {𝑥₂,𝑥₁}}
                    i.e. 2 different edges connecting same vertices

def max_edges: 𝑛(𝑛 - 1)/2
    𝑛 = number of members
    (𝑛 - 1) = the universe of members that can be paired with 
    since we disallow multi edges, we remove the duplicate pairings. hence  division by 2
