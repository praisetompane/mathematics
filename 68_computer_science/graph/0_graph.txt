def graph(Leighton, van Dijk, 2010): 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: 
            graph G is a set of sets 𝑉 and 𝐸:
                𝑉 = nonempty set of items called vertices/nodes.
                𝐸 = set of 2-item sets, which are subsets of 𝑉 called edges
                    𝐸 = {{𝑎,𝑏} : 𝑎,𝑏 ∈ 𝑉}.
                ∴ 𝐸 ⊂ 𝑉
