def derivative¹(Hammack: 2020):
    - formal:
            
        - in words:
            - the derivative of a function 𝑓 
                is another function 𝑓', for which
                𝑓'(x) = (
                            the slope of the tangent line to 
                                y=𝑓(x) at point (x, 𝑓(x))
                        )
            
                      - (   
                            the rate of change of 𝑓(x)
                            with respect to x at x
                        )

    - geometric (Jerison, 2007):
        problem: find tangent line
                    to some function y = f(x)
                    at some point P = (x₀, y₀).

                              y -            /<--- tangent line

                                -
                                ↓

            problem: how do we do this analytically?
                def tangent line equation: y - y₀ = m(x - x₀)

                data requirements:
                    point(i.e. P): y₀ = f(x₀) = (x₀, y₀)
                    slope: m = f'(x₀)
                            NB: This is the derivative of f.

                def f'(x₀)(i.e. the derivative of f at x₀): the slope of the tangent line
                                                                to f(x)
                                                                at a point P.
