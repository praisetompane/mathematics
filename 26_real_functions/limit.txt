def limit(Censor, 2013):
    - formal:
        𝑙𝑖𝑚     𝑓(𝑥) = 𝐿 𝑖𝑓
        𝑥->𝑎 
            ∀ϵ>0 ∃δ>0 𝑠.𝑡 
            0 < |𝑥 - 𝑎| < δ ⟹ |𝑓(𝑥) - 𝐿| < ϵ
            
        - in words:
            the limit as 𝑥 approaches 𝑎
                for 𝑓(𝑥) equals 𝐿 
                    if
                        for all epsilon(ϵ) greater than zero(0)
                            there exists delta(δ) greater than zero(0)
                                such that
                                    the absolute difference of 𝑥 and 𝑎 is greater than zero(0) AND less than delta(δ)
                                        implies
                                            the absolute difference of 𝑓(𝑥) and 𝐿 is less than epsilon(ϵ)
            
    - plain english:
        the limit as 𝑥 approaches 𝑎 for 𝑓(𝑥) equals 𝐿
        implies the absolute difference of 𝑓(𝑥) and 𝐿 is less epsilon(ϵ)
            if 
                for all epsilon(ϵ) greater than zero(0)
                    there exists a delta(δ) greater than zero(0)
                        such that the absolute difference of 𝑥 and 𝑎 is greater than zero(0) and less than delta(δ)
        NB: double check this description later.
