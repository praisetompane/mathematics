def slope | gradient (Khan Academy):
    - formal: 풊洧녽/풊洧논
        - in words: change in rise(洧녽) divided by change in run(洧논).

    - plain english:
        - how much change
            happens in 洧녽
                for a change in 洧논
            NB: It is a ratio of the change in y with respect to the change in 洧논.
            Question: f(풊x) -> 풊y
                is slope a function 洧녭, from a 풊 in 洧논 to a 풊 in y?: No, it is a ratio.

        - how steep a line is.
        - how quickly does it increase
        - how quickly does it decrease
