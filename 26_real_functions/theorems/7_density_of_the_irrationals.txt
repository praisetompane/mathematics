def density_of_the_irrationals(Censor, 2013)::
    - formal: ∀𝑥<𝑦 ∈ ℝ, ∃𝑞 ∈ ℝ\ℚ  s.t. 𝑥 < 𝑞 < 𝑦
  
        - in words:
            for any interval between 𝑥 and 𝑦 in the Real numbers,
            where 𝑥 is less than 𝑦,
            there exists a number 𝑞 between 𝑥 and 𝑦 that belongs in the Irrational numbers.
           
    - plain english:
        between any two distinct Real numbers, there exists at least one Irrational number.
