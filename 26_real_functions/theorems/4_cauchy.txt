    - formal
        Let: 
            f(𝑥) and g(x) 
                be continuous on [a,b]
                AND differentiable on (a,b).

            Assume that:
                ∀x ∈ (a,b), g'(x) ≠ 0.

        Then:
            1. g(a) ≠ g(b)
            2. ∃c ∈ (a,b)
                such that:
                   f'(c)    f(b) - f(a)

        - generalizes Legrange's theorem:
            solution:
                Let g(x) = x : a straight line
                Then:
                    f'(c)    f(b) - f(a)
                    ----- =  -----------
                    g'(c)    g(b) - g(a)


                    f'(c)    f(b) - f(a)
                    ----- =  -----------
                      1      g(b) - g(a)  : g'(c) = 1:
                                                - because the derivative of x is 1.
                                                - because the derivative of a straight line function at any point is 1.
                                                    i.e. its slope is 1(i.e. the rate of change between the points is 1).

                            f(b) - f(a)     f'(c) 
                    f'(c) =  -----------  : -----  = f'(c): because any numerator divided by 1, equals the numerator.
                            g(b) - g(a)       1 


                             f(b) - f(a)
                    f'(c) =  ----------- 
                               b - a      : because g(b) = b and g(a) = a, since g is defined as g(x) = x.
                                                i.e. returns/equals the same value of its parameter.

                        NB: This equation is Legrange's theorem.

    - mathematician lifetime: 1789 - 1857
        - remarks: 
            - invented/discovered and used the precise notion of the term "The Limit".
                - other attributions:   
                    - Karl Weierstrass: 1815 - 1897
            - The Limit term is the foundation of analysis and is used to define all structures in it, such as:
                - continuity
                - derivatives
                - integrals
                - series
                - ...
