        - generalizes Rolle's theorem:
            solution:
                Let
                    f(b) = f(a) : in Rolle's theorem f(b) = f(a).
                
                Then:
                    f'(c) =  f(b) - f(a)
                            -------------
                                b - a

                    f'(c) =   0 : since the value f(b) equals f(a), their difference is zero(0).
                            -----
                            b - a
                    
                    f'(c) = 0 : because zero(0) divided by any number is zero.
                    
                    ‚ä¢ when f(b) = f(a), there exists a point c
                            such that f'(c) = 0.
                        NB: This is Rolle's theorem.
