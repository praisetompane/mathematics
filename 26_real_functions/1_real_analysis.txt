def analysis | real analysis | infinitesimal analysis(Weisstein):
    - formal: ???

    - plain english: a field in mathematics, that studies the following:
                        - the rate of change of quantities(interpreted as slopes of a curve)
                        - lines, area and volume of objects.

    - intuition: the study of change in a varying variable/s,
                    in which the gap between the adjacent points is infinitesimal(Devlin, 2012),

    - properties: ???

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
