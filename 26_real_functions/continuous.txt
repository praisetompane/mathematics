def continuous (Censor, 2013):
    formal:
        - TBD
    plain english:
        - TBD
    intuition: for a function to be continuous
                    the graph of the function
                        can be drawn without lifting the "pen/marker"
                            off the "paper/board".
                i.e. no jumps between points in the graph.
