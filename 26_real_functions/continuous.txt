def continuous (Censor, 2013):
    - formal:
        - ???
    - plain english:
        - ???
    - intuition: for a function to be continuous
                    the graph of the function
                        can be drawn without lifting the "pen/marker"
                            off the "paper/board".
                 i.e. no jumps between points in the graph.
