    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition:
        - for a function to be differentiable, the properties below must be satisfied:
            - the graph/chart of the function,
                is smooth (has no cusps(pointy/sharp sections)).
            - the derivative exists for every point.

    - properties: ???

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: ???
