        - in words:
            - the derivative of a function 𝑓 
                is another function 𝑓', for which
                𝑓'(x) = (
                            the slope of the tangent line to 
                                𝑦=𝑓(x) at point (𝑥, 𝑓(x))
                        )
            
                      - (   
                            the rate of change of 𝑓(x)
                            with respect to 𝑥 at 𝑥
                        )

            - geometric (Jerison, 2007):
                problem: find tangent line
                            to some function 𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥)
                            at some point 𝑃 = (𝑥₀, 𝑦₀).

                    solution:
                                        ↑
                                    y -            /<--- tangent line
                                        |         /
                                        -       ./
                                        |    P ./   y = f(x)
                                        -    . / 
                                        |. .  /
                       ← |---|--|---|---|---|/-|---|---| →
                                        |   /  x₀      x 
                                        -  /
                                        |
                                        -
                                        |
                                        -
                                        ↓

                    problem: how do we do this analytically?
                        def tangent line equation: y - y₀ = m(x - x₀)

                        data requirements:
                            point(i.e. P): y₀ = f(x₀) = (x₀, y₀)
                            slope: m = f'(x₀)
                                    NB: This is the derivative of f.

                        def f'(x₀)(i.e. the derivative of f at x₀): the slope of the tangent line
                                                                        to f(x)
                                                                        at a point P.
