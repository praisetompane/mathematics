graph G is a set of sets V and E 
    V = nonempty set of items called vertices/nodes
    E = set of 2-item sets, which are subsets of V called edges
        E = {{a,b} | a,b ∈ V} (Leighton, van Dijk, 2010).
    ∴ E ⊂ V

example:
      x₂-----x₆ 
   e₁/
    /
   x₁---------x₄
    \          \
     x₅         x₃

G =  {V, E}
V = { x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅, x₆ }
E = {
        {x₁, x₂},
        {x₁, x₅},
        {x₁, x₄},
        {x₂, x₆},
        {x₄, x₃}
    }
