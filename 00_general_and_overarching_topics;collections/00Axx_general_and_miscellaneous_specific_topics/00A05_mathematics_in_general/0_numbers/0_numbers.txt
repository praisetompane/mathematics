def number(Hamkins, 2020):
    - formal: ???

        - in words:
            - remark:
                - (Karagila, 2022):
                    - we have no Mathematical definition for what a number is.
                    - we constructions of what a number 𝑐𝑎𝑛 be.
                - the question of what number is, belongs to the Philosophy of Mathematics and its ontological concerns.

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: a label for quantity(Karagila, 2022).

    - properties:
        - based on: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Exx_set_theory/3_cardinality.txt
        - number vs numeral
            - example:
                - number = fifty seven
                - numerals:
                    57 - decimal(base 10)
                    111001 - binary
                    LVII - roman numerals

        Q: Can we use the irrational numbers for any of these?
            - What would these mean?:
                - I have √2 apples.
                - I finished in position π the race.

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
