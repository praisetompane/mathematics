    - properties:
        - natural numbers as Von Neumann Ordinals(Goldrei, 1996):
            - prerequisites:
                - zero defined as the empty set: 0 = {} = ∅
                - successor function: 𝑆(𝑛) = 𝑛 ∪ {𝑛}

            - constructions:
                - 0 = {} = ∅

                - 1 = 𝑆(0)
                    = 0 ∪ {∅}
                    = ∅ ∪ {∅}

                    - remarks(Kuber, 2024):
                        - this is our first infinite ordinal
                            see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Exx_set_theory/3_ordinal.txt
                        - guaranteed by axiom of infinity
                            see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Exx_set_theory/0_zfc_set_theory/0_axioms/7_infinity.txt
                        - this is our model for the natural numbers(i.e. ℕ)
            remark:
                (Kuber, 2024):
                        these set representations above, are one representative/instance from the respective equivalence class,
                            to enable easier manipulation of the numbers.
                            i.e.
                                - {∅, {∅}, {∅,{∅}}} is one of the sets in the equivalence class of sets with 3 objects,
                                        and we use it to represent the number 3.

    - examples: there is only one set of natural numbers(i.e. ℕ)

    - uses cases:
        - counting (e.g. 3 apples, 2 goats)etc.
        - ordering
        - solution to equations:
            - example:
                - given:
                    equation₁: 𝑥 + 1 = 5
                - then:
                    𝑥 + 1 - 1 = 5 - 1
                    𝑥 + 0 = 5 - 1
                    𝑥 = 4
                - substitution test:
                    let:
                        𝑥 = 4
                    then:
                        𝑥 + 1 = 5
                        4 + 1 = 5
                        5 = 5, which is true

                - 5 is a Natural number, therefore the Natural number 5 can be used to solve this equation.

    - proof: none. it is a definition.

def natural number(Wildberger, 2009):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english: a string of ones(i.e. one = |)

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples:
        - || = two
        - ||||| = five
        - ||| = three

    - use cases:
        see: above.

    - proof: none. it is a definition.

def natural numbers set¹(Wildberger, 2009):
    - formal: {𝑥 : 𝑥 = ⟨|,|,|,...⟩}

        - in words: the set of all numbers 𝑥,
                        such that 𝑥 is a string of ones.

    - plain english: ???

    - properties:
        - they form a sequence(i.e. they are naturally ordered):
            - formal: 𝑆(𝑛) = 𝑛 + |
                - in words: the successor of 𝑛 is 𝑛 plus |
            - plain english: for every natural number, we can associate/define/determine a "successor":
                - example:
                    S(|) = || = successor of | is ||

            remark: this is our first Mathematical operator/operation.

            - Question: Why do Natural numbers form a sequence?
                MYINC:
                    1. We start with |
                    2. to get || we require | to exist, because we add | to | to get ||.
                    3. to get ||| we require || to exist, because  we add | to || to get |||

                    NB: They come into existence in an order.

        - they have relative size to each other:
            - formal:
                let:
                    - 𝑛 and 𝑚 be natural numbers
                then:
                    - equality:
                        - formal: 𝑛 = 𝑚 ⟺ the ones(i.e. |) in 𝑛 match the ones(i.e. |) in 𝑚.

                            - in words:
                                𝑛 equals 𝑚, if and only if, the ones(i.e. |) in 𝑛 match the ones(i.e. |) in 𝑚.

                        remark: this is our second Mathematical operator.

                    - inequality:
                        - formal: 𝑛 < m ⟺ the ones(i.e. |) in n are less than the ones(i.e. |) in 𝑚.

                            - in words:
                                𝑛 is less than 𝑚, if and only if, the ones(i.e. |) in 𝑛 are less than the ones(i.e. |) in 𝑚.

                        remark: this is our third Mathematical operator.

            - plain english: which number appears first in the sequence.
                - example:
                    - given: two numbers
                            ||||
                            ||||||
                    - then:
                        - pair each one(i.e. |) in one number with a one in the other number.
                    - then:
                        - the number left with unpaired ones(i.e. |) is the larger of the two.

                    - therefore:
                        - |||| comes before |||||| in the sequence of Natural numbers.
                        - |||||| is greater than ||||, because it has || left after pairing all the |s from |||| with itself.

    - examples:
        see: above.

    - use cases:
        see: above.

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
