def mathematical ability(Devlin, 2012):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - ingredients for mathematics:
            - spatial reasoning ability: think about space, your position in space, and others object's position in space.
                - evolutionary reason: movement

            - number sense: sense of a size of a collection.
                - evolutionary reason: understand threat size(run if outnumbered or fight otherwise), food source size.
                - properties:
                    - does not require numbers
                    - possessed by:
                        - other animals
                        - very young babies

            - numerical ability: number sense + language
                - evolutionary reason: greater precision about collections of things.
                - see: 00_general_and_overarching_topics;collections/00Axx_general_and_miscellaneous_specific_topics/00A05_mathematics_in_general/0_numbers
                - properties:
                    - requires numbers
                    - depends on language(Dehaene, 2011)
                        - numbers are linguistic constructs and embedded in language.
                    - possessed only by humans
                        - limited form in other apes

            - a sense of cause and effect:
                - evolutionary reason: ???

            - the ability to construct and follow a casual chain of events or facts:
                - evolutionary reason: ???

            - algorithmic ability:
                - evolutionary reason: planning sequences ahead of time.
                    - example:
                        - trajectory of a spear

            - logical reasoning ability:
                - evolutionary reason:

            - ability to handle abstraction: engage with concepts at general/higher level and combine them.
                - evolutionary reason: ???

                NB:
                    - Key to mathematical ability.
                    - equivalent to having language

            - relational reasoning ability: the ability to think about how things relate to each other.
                - evolutionary reason:
                    - social cooperation for survival
                    - understand human relationships

        - mathematical ability acquisition rough timeline:
            ~35000 years ago: invent counting:
                - examples:
                    - Ishango bone

            ~10000 years ago: invent numbers
                - examples:
                    -

            ~2000 years ago: start formal Mathematics
                - examples:
                    -

        - fields of study:
            - Mathematical Cognition:
                - counting:
                    Q: Why do we count?
                    Q: When did we start counting?
                    Q: Did we always count up to ten as homo sapiens?
                        hence base 10 system so natural?
                    Q: what is counting?

                - number sense:
                    Q: Where does the idea of "how many" things are there come from?
                    Q: Humans and other animals show case the ability to "know(by way of counting? Are there other ways to know how many things are there?" "how many" things are there.

                - numbers:
                    Q: Where/When did give these quantities names?
                    Q: names for quantities?

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: ???
