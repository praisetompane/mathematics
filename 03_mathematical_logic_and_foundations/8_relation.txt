def binary relation (Epp, 2010:442):   
    - formal: the totality
                of ordered pairs
                    whose members
                        are related by some condition (Epp, 2010:14).

            a mathematical structure R is a relation
                between sets A(domain) and B(co-domain), if the properties below are satisfied (Epp, 2010:14):
            
                1. there exists x in A and
                    y in B such that
                        (x,y) in R

                2. R is a subset of A x B (i.e. Cartesian product of set A and B)
                    
    - plain english: a subgroup of ordered pairs
                        from a bigger group
                            connected
                                based on a condition.
