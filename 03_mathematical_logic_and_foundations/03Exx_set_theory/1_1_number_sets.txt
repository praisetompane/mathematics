            - def empty set(i.e. ∅)(Hammack, 2018):
                - formal:
                    ∅ = {}
                    - in words:  set with no elements

                - intuition:
                    - an empty box

                - properties:
                    - cardinality:
                        |∅| = 0
                        NB: it is the only set with a cardinality of zero(0)
                    - ∅ is a subset of every set:
                        NB: It does NOT belong(i.e. ∈) to every set though.

                        - proof: it is trivially/vacuously true, because ∅ has no elements and you can't pick any to check
                                        their existence in the other set.
