def universe of sets:
    - formal:
        let:
            a = 𝑤(omega) NB: This is due to a limitation in the extension for generating a subscript with ω

            𝑉₀ = set of atoms, which are NOT sets.
                - They can be numbers, letters, any object etc.
                - The atoms are indivisible, they contain nothing.
        then:
            𝑉₁ = 𝑃(𝑉₀) ∪ 𝑉₀
            𝑉₂ = 𝑃(𝑉₁) ∪ 𝑉₁
            𝑉₃ = 𝑃(𝑉₂) ∪ 𝑉₂
            .
            .
            .
            𝑉ₐ = 𝑉₀ ∪ 𝑉₁ ∪ 𝑉₂ ∪ 𝑉₃ ...
            𝑉ₐ₊₁ = 𝑃(𝑉ᵤ) ∪ 𝑉ₐ
            𝑉ₐ₊₂ = 𝑃(𝑉ₐ₊₁) ∪ 𝑉ₐ₊₁
            𝑉ₐ₊₃ = 𝑃(𝑉ₐ₊₂) ∪ 𝑉ₐ₊₂
            .
            .
            .
            𝑉ₐ₊ₐ = 𝑉₀ ∪ 𝑉₁ ∪ 𝑉₂ ∪ 𝑉₃ ... ∪ 𝑉ₐ ∪ 𝑉ₐ₊₁ ∪ 𝑉ₐ₊₂ ∪ 𝑉ₐ₊₃ ...
            .
            .
            .
            𝑉ₐ₊ₐ₊₁ = 𝑃(𝑉ₐ₊ₐ) ∪ 𝑉ₐ₊ₐ
            .
            .
            .
            Continue through each ordinal.

        - in words: ???

    - plain english:
        - A concept to model large collections of objects that cannot be modelled as a set.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - This object is NOT a set.
            - When considered as a set, it produces contradictions.
    - examples: ???

    - use cases:

    - proof:
        - The universe of sets is NOT a set:
            - By contradiction:
                let:
                    𝑉 = set of all sets
                then:
                    𝑉 ∈ 𝑉, 𝑉 is a member of itself.

                let:
                    𝐵 = { 𝑥 ∈ 𝑉 : 𝑥 ∉ 𝑥}, 𝐵 is a set with all members of 𝑉, that do NOT belong to themselves.
                then:
                    Does 𝐵 belong to itself?
                    𝐵 ∈ 𝐵 ⟺ 𝐵 ∉ 𝐵, 𝐵 belongs to itself, if and only if it does NOT belong to itself
                    This in a contradiction, 𝐵 cannot both belong to itself and NOT belong to itself.
