def Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice(Kunen, 2007:10-11):
    - formal:
        - axioms:
            axiom 0: Set Existence
                    ∃𝑥(𝑥 = 𝑥)

            axiom 1: Extensibility
                    ∀𝑧(𝑧 ∈ 𝑥 ⟺ 𝑧 ∈ 𝑦) ⟹ 𝑥 = 𝑦

            axiom 2: Foundation
                    ∃𝑦(𝑦 ∈ 𝑥) ⟹ ∃𝑦(𝑦 ∈ 𝑥 ∧ ¬∃𝑧(𝑧 ∈ 𝑥 ∧ 𝑧 ∈ 𝑦))

            axiom 3: Comprehension Scheme
                    for each formula φ, without y free,
                        ∃𝑦∀𝑥(𝑥 ∈ 𝑦 ⟺ 𝑥 ∈ 𝑧 ∧ φ(𝑥))

            axiom 4: Pairing
                    ∃𝑧(𝑥 ∈ 𝑧 ∧ 𝑦 ∈ 𝑧)

            axiom 5: Union
                    ∃𝐴 ∀𝑌 ∀𝑥 (𝑥 ∈ 𝑌 ∧ 𝑌 ∈ 𝐹 ⟹ 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴)

            axiom 6: Replacement Scheme
                    for each formula φ, without B free
                        ∀𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∃!𝑦 φ(𝑥,𝑦) ⟹ ??? 

            axiom 7: Infinity
            axiom 8: Power Set
            axiom 9: Choice

        - in words: ???

        Q: Does an object need to satisfy these axioms to be considered a set?

    - plain english:list of axioms to axiomatize all of Mathematics.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: 
        - foundational system for Mathematics.
        - mathematical theory of sets, on which the rest of mathematics is based (Wildberger, 2015).
        
    - proof: ???
