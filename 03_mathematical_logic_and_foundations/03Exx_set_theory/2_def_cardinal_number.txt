def cardinal number or cardinal or cardinality or size(Hammack, 2018:4):
    formal:
        for a finite set,
            this is the number of elements in the set,
            denoted as |set_name|
            
            example:
                Let:
                    A = {1,2}
                Then:
                    |A| = 2
                    i.e. cardinality/size of A is 2.
