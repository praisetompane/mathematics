def powerset(Montalban, 2020)(Hower, 2020):
    - formal:
        let:
            𝐴 be a set.
        then:
            𝑃(𝐴) = { 𝑥 : 𝑥 ⊂ 𝐴 }

        - in words: the powerset of 𝐴 is set of all subsets of 𝐴.

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - number of element in powerset of 𝐴(i.e. 𝑃(𝐴)):
            - formal:
                given:
                    |𝐴| = 𝑛
                then:
                    |𝑃(𝐴)| = 2ⁿ
            - proof: ???

    - examples:
        - powerset of 𝐴:
            given:
                𝐴 = { 2, 3 }
            then:
                𝑃(𝐴) = 𝐴⁰ ∪ 𝐴¹ ∪ 𝐴²
                     = {∅} ∪ {{2} ∪ {3}} ∪ {{2, 3}}
                     = {∅, {2}, {3}, {2, 3}}

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: ???
