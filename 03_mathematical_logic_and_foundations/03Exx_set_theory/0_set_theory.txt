def set theory(Kunen, 2007:10-11):
    - formal:
        - in words: ???

    - plain english: a branch Mathematics that studies sets.
        
        see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Exx_set_theory/1_set.txt

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: 
        - variations:
            - Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice(ZFC): current axiomatic system for all Mathematics.
                see: 
            - von Neumann-Gödel-Bernay set theorem(NGB)
            - ...

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: 
        - foundational system for Mathematics.
        - mathematical theory of sets, on which the rest of mathematics is based (Wildberger, 2015).
        
    - proof: none. it is a definition.
