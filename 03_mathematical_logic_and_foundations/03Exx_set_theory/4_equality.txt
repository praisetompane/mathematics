def equality:
    - formal:
        let:
            - 𝐴 be a set
            - 𝐵  be a set
        then:
            - 𝐴 = 𝐵 ⟺ 𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐵 ⊆ 𝐴

        - in words:
            - set are equal if they are subsets of each other.
            - sets are equal if they have the same elements, in any order with different repetitions.
