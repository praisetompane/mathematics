def cardinal | cardinal number | cardinality | size(Hammack, 2018:4)(Hower, 2020):
    - formal:
        for a finite set,
            this is the number of elements in the set,
            denoted as |set_name|

            example:
                let:
                    ùê¥ = {1,2}
                then:
                    |ùê¥| = 2
                    i.e. cardinality/size of A is 2.

        - in words: ???

    - plain english:
        number of elements in a set.
        for finite sets, this number is in ‚Ñï (·∂ú‚Å±·µó·µÉ·µó‚Å±·¥º‚Åø_‚Åø·µâ·µâ·µà)
            i.e. it is a Natural number.

                notation:
                    ùê¥ = {}
                    |ùê¥| := cardinality of set ùê¥
