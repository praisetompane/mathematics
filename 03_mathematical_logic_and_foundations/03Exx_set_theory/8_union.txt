def ∪ | union:
    - formal:
        let:
            - 𝐴 be a set
            - 𝐵 be a set
        then:
            - 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 := { 𝑥 : 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∨ 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵}

        - in words: a set constructed with all elements in 𝐴 and 𝐵.

    - plain english: ???

    - examples:
        -
            let:
                - 𝐴 = {1, 2}
                - 𝐵 = {1, 3}
            then:
                𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = {1, 1, 2, 3 } = {1, 2, 3}
