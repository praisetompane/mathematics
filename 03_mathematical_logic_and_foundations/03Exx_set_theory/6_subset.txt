def subset¹ (⊂ | ⊆ )(Montalban, 2020):
    - formal:
        - given:
            𝐴 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐵 
        - then:
            𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 𝑖𝑓 ∀𝑥 ∈ 𝐴, ∃𝑦 ∈ 𝐵 such that 𝑥 = 𝑦

        - in words:
            every element in A exists in B.
        
        NB: Do not confuse with belongs(i.e. ∈)
        
    - plain english: 𝐴 is included in 𝐵 or 𝐴 is a subset of 𝐵.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - transitivity does NOT apply.
            - examples:
                -   given:
                        𝐴 = {2,3}
                        𝐵 = {{2,3},5,6}
                        𝐶 = {{{2,3},5,6},7,9}
                    then:
                        𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 = True, because all the elements 𝐴(i.e. 2 and 3) are in 𝐵.
                        𝐵 ⊂ 𝐶 = True, because the set 𝐵(i.e. {{2,3},5,6}) is an element of 𝐶.
                        A ⊂ 𝐶 = False, because the set 𝐴(i.e. {2,3}) is not an element of 𝐶.
                            NB: it is an element of the first element(i.e. set 𝐵) in 𝐶, but 
                                    it is NOT in 𝐶 itself.

        - ∅ is a subset of every set:
            NB: It does NOT belong(i.e. ∈ ) to every set though.

            - intuition: it is trivially/vacuously true, because ∅ has no elements and you can't pick any to check
                            their existence in the other set.
                                         
            - proof: ???

    - examples:
        -   given:
                𝐴 = {2,3}
                𝐵 = {2,3,5,6}
            then:
                𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 = True

        -   given:
                𝐴 = {1,2}
                𝐵 = {3,2,4,5}
            then:
                𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵  = True
                ∴ 𝐴 ⊄ 𝐵

                
    - use cases: ???
        
    - proof: ???
