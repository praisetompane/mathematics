def extensionality(Kunen, 2007:10-11):

    - formal: ∀𝑥 ∀𝑦 (∀𝑧(𝑧 ∈ 𝑥 ⟺ 𝑧 ∈ 𝑦) ⟹ 𝑥 = 𝑦)

        in words: ???

    - plain english: two sets are equal if they have the same elements regardless of their order and repetition(Montalban, 2020).

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples:
        let:
            𝐴 = {2,3}
            𝐵 = {2,2,3,3}
            𝐶 = {3,2}
            𝐷 = {3,3,2,2}
        then:
            𝐴 = 𝐵 = 𝐶 = 𝐷

    - use cases:
        - define set equality:
            - its definition makes sets with repeating objects and different object order the same(i.e. {1,1,2,3} = {2,1,3})

    - proof: none. it is an axiom.
