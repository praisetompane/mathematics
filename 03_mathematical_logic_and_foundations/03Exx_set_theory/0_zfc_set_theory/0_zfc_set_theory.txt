def Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice(Kunen, 2007:10-11):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english: an axiomatized set theory.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - formal system:
            - language:
                - alphabet|symbols:
                    - vocabulary alphabet|symbols
                        ∈  := in (is element of)

                    - operations alphabet|symbols:
                        ∩  := intersection
                        ∪  := union
                        \|- := subtraction
                        {} := set constructor

                - grammar:
                    - ...

            - It has no atoms, therefore:
                𝑉₀ = ∅          = ∅
                𝑉₁ = {∅}        = {∅}
                𝑉₂ = 𝑃(𝑉₁) ∪ 𝑉₁ = {∅, {∅}} ∪ {∅}
                𝑉₃ = 𝑃(𝑉₂) ∪ 𝑉₂ = {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}} ∪ {∅, {∅}}
                .
                .
                .

        - every object is a set.

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - foundational system for Mathematics(Montalban, 2020).
        - Mathematical theory of sets, on which the rest of mathematics is based (Wildberger, 2015).

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
