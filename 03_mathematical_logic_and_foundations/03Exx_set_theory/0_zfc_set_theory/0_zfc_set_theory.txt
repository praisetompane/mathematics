def Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice(Kunen, 2007:10-11):
  - formal:
    - axioms:
        see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Exx_set_theory/1_axioms

      Q: Does an object need to satisfy these axioms to be considered a set?

  - plain english: list of axioms to axiomatize all of Mathematics.

  - intuition: ???

  - properties: ???

  - examples: ???

  - use cases: 
      - foundational system for Mathematics(Montalban, 2020).
      - mathematical theory of sets, on which the rest of mathematics is based (Wildberger, 2015).
      
  - proof: none. they are axioms.
