def Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice(Kunen, 2007:10-11):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english: an axiomatized set theory.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - every object is a set.

        - universe of sets in ZFC: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Exx_set_theory/8_universe_of_sets.txt
            - It has no atoms, therefore:
                𝑉₀ = ∅          = ∅
                𝑉₁ = {∅}        = {∅}
                𝑉₂ = 𝑃(𝑉₁) ∪ 𝑉₁ = {∅, {∅}} ∪ {∅}
                𝑉₃ = 𝑃(𝑉₂) ∪ 𝑉₂ = {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}} ∪ {∅, {∅}}
                .
                .
                .

        - formal system:
            - language: uses first order logic's language.

                - alphabet|symbols:
                    - vocabulary alphabet|symbols
                        ∈  := in (is element of)

                    - punctuation alphabet|symbols:
                        - (     = opening parenthesis
                        - )     = closing parenthesis

                    - operations alphabet|symbols:
                        ∩  := intersection
                        ∪  := union
                        \|- := subtraction
                        {} := set constructor

                - variable alphabet|symbols: {𝑎₁, 𝑎₂, 𝑎ₙ, ϕ, ψ, ...}, used to represent sets.

                - grammar:
                    - ...

            - deductive system: uses first order logic's deductive system:
                - axioms:
                    - types:
                        - existential axioms: guarantee the existence of certain sets.
                        - set construction axioms: describe how to construct new sets from the existing sets.

                - rules of inference: uses first order logic's rules of inference.

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - foundational system for Mathematics(Montalban, 2020).
        - Mathematical theory of sets, on which the rest of mathematics is based (Wildberger, 2015).

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
