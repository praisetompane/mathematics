def cardinal number | cardinal | cardinality:
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english: 
        number of elements in a set.
            for finite sets, this number is in ℕ (ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᴼⁿ_ⁿᵉᵉᵈ)
                i.e. it is a Natural number.

                    notation:
                        A = {}
                        |A| := cardinality of set A
