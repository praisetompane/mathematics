        then:
            ⟨𝑎₁, a₂, ..., aₙ⟩ : 𝑎ᵢ ∈ 𝐴

        - in words: an 𝑛-tuple of elements from 𝐴.

    - plain english: an ordered and finite list of elements from 𝐴.

    - intuition: a sequence of symbols.

        let:

        then:
            ⟨⟩ is an empty string.
            ⟨a⟩ is a string of one element.
            ⟨a,a⟩ is a string of two elements.
            ⟨a,b⟩ is a string of two elements.
            ⟨a,b,a⟩ is a string of three elements.

        remark: in Computer Science, we write them without the commas(Sipser, 2012:14).
