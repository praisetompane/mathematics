def function:
    - formal: a relation F, is a function 
                from a set A(domain) to a set B(co-domain), if it satisfies the properties below(Epp, 2010:17):

                    1. ∀x ∈ A, ∃y ∈ B s.t. (x,y) ∈ F
                    
                        in words: for all elements x in A,
                                    there is an element y in B
                                        such that (x,y) in F
                         

                    2. ∀x ∈ A, ∀y,z ∈ B
                       (x,y) ∈ F and (x,z) ∈ F, then
                            y = z
                                    
                       in words: for all elements x in A,
                                 for all elements y and z in B
                                 if (x,y) in F and (x,z) in F, then
                                    y = z
                
                        i.e. a member in A can map to ONLY
                                one in member B.
                                if it maps to two, they are the same.
    
    

    - plain english: a mapping,
                        between two groups of things, named A and B
                        where
                            each thing in group A
                                can only map to ONE thing in group B.

def function graph⁽ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᴼⁿˢ_ᵃⁿᵈ_ᶜᴼʳʳᵉᶜᵗⁱᴼⁿˢ_ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ⁾:
    NB: uniquely represents a function
    - formal:
        given: f: X ⟶ Y

        then:
            G(f) = { (x, f(x)) x ∈ X }

            G(f) = graph of f.

        general?:    
            x = {x,y, ...}
            G(f) = { (x, f(x)) | x ∈ X }

            NB: x is an n-tuple.
                    i.e. a list of multiple variables.
                        that list can be a list of 1 variable.
                This allows Multivariable functions.

        - in words:
            the set of all 
                ordered pairs of (x,y)
                where y = f(x)
