def implies:
    - formal:
        let:
            A be a proposition.
            B be a proposition.
        then:
            A ⟹ B is defined as:
                A   B   A ⟹ B
                T   T     T
                T   F     F
                F   T     T
                F   F     T

        - in words: a binary operator from truth values to a single truth value,
                    according to the rules below
                        if A is True  and B is True,   then A implies B is/returns True
                        if A is True  and B is False,  then A implies B is/returns False
                        if A is False and B is True,   then A implies B is/returns True
                        if A is False and B is False,  then A implies B is/returns True
