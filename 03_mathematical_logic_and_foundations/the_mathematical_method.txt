def the mathematical method(Devlin, 2012):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - flow:
            1. identify a particular pattern in the world.
            2. study the pattern.
            3. develop a notation to describe the pattern.
            4. use that notation to further study the notation.

            5. formulate basic assumptions(i.e. axioms) to capture the fundamental properties of the abstracted pattern.
            6. study the abstracted pattern, establishing truth by means of rigorous proofs from the axioms.
            7. develop procedures that you and others may use to apply the results of the study to the world.

            8. apply the results to the world

            remarks: step 5 - 7 is regarded as the Mathematics(i.e. Pure Mathematics)

    - examples:
        - 12_field_theory_and_polynomials/1_field.txt

    - use cases:
        - develop/discover new Mathematics.

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
