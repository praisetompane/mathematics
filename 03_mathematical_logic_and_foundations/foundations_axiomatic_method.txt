def foundations_axiomatic_method¹ (Kunen, 2007:5):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english: involves/uses the axiomatic method.
        def axiomatic method (Kunen, 2007:5): we define/select axioms then
                                                proof theorems from the axioms.

            NB: the justification for the axioms
                    is part of the motivation or physics or philosophy
                    NOT part of the Mathematics itself.

                see: 00_general_and_overarching_topics;collections/00Axx_general_and_miscellaneous_specific_topics/00A30_philosophy_of_mathematics
                the mathematics itself
                    consists of logical deductions
                        from axioms (Kunen, 2007:5).

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - types of uses of the concept/word "axioms"(Kunen, 2007:47):
            - statements of faith
            - definitional axioms

            NB: 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠

            def statements of faith:
                - statements that are obviously true, and thus require no proof.
                - closest to truism.

                - example:
                    Greek Classical View:
                        - make observations about Real Physical Space, which are obviously true.
                        - then from them, we can derive other non-obvious facts.
                               
            def definitional axioms:
                - defines a useful class of structure.
                - captures the structure of things/ideas and proves theorems about them.
                    NB: One finds various instances of these things/ideas 
                            in various domains.
                            domains = {Mathematics, Real Physical Space, Computation, ...}
                - common in algebra

                - example:
                    axioms of Groups define/captures what a Group is.
                        see: 20_group_theory_and_generalizations
                        instances of Group:
                            {
                                (ℤ,+) = The Integers with respect to addition.
                            }
                    
                    axioms of fields define/captures what a Field is: 
                        see: 12_field_theory_and_polynomials
                        instances of Fields:
                            {   (ℝ, +, ×) = The Real Numbers with respect to addition and multiplication,
                                (ℂ, +, ×) = The Complex Numbers with respect to addition and multiplication,
                                (ℚ, +, ×) = The Rational Numbers with respect to addition and multiplication,
                                ...
                            }

    - examples: axiomatic method examples(Kunen, 2007:5-9):
        - Geometry (Kunen, 2007:5):
            - these are definitional axioms.
                - they were statements of faith in Euclid's Geometry prior to Einstein's advances in Physics.

            Euclid Postulate(axiom) 1:
                ∀x,y[Point(x) ∧ Point(y) ∧ x ≠ y] ⟹ ∃!z[Line(z) ∧ LiesOn(x,z) ∧ LiesOn(y,z)]
                    domain of discourse = all geometric objects.

                english: any two distinct points
                            determine a unique line.

        - Group Theory (Kunen, 2007:6):
            - these are definitional axioms.
            - based on these axioms: see: 20_group_theory_and_generalizations
                GP is a 𝑠𝑒𝑡 of two sentences in 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑐  
            example:
                𝐺𝑃 implies the cancellation rule:
                    𝐺𝑃 ⊢ ∀x,y[x ∘ y = x ∘ z ⟹ y = z]

        - Set Theory (Kunen, 2007:7): 
            - these are definitional axioms.
            - based on Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice axiom (ZFC).
            - all of modern Mathematics is based on Set theory.

    - use cases: ???
        
    - proof: ???
