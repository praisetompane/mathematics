def foundations of mathematics(Wildberger, 2009):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english:
        - Mathematics begins with a blank/empty space(i.e. nothing):
            - in it we introduce the following:
                1. "|": 
                    | represents a single entity:
                            we name | as one
                        NB: this can be any symbol(i.e. *, -, ., etc)

                2. the idea of adding one(i.e."|") to itself:
                    - | and | = ||
                        we name || as two

                3. iterate: the idea of adding | to what we already have:
                    - examples:
                        || and |:
                            we name ||| as three
                        
                        ||| and |:
                            we name |||| as four
                        
                        |||| and |:
                            we name ||||| as five
                        ...
                - remarks: 
                    - These are the natural numbers.
                        see: /mathematics/00_numbers/0_number_systems/0_decimal_number_system/1_complex_numbers/0_real_numbers/0_fractions/rational_numbers/integers/natural_numbers
                    - These are our first Mathematical objects.
                    - All Mathematical objects are based on the natural numbers.

                Question: do we require natural language to create Mathematics?

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???
        
    - proof: ???
