    - properties:
        - archetypes(Devlin, 2012:27-28): all mathematical statements are positive or negative versions of the statements below:
            - a. object ùëé has property ùëÉ.
            - b. every object of type ùëá, has property ùëÉ.
            - c. there exists an object of type ùëá, having property ùëÉ.
            - d. if statement ùê¥, then statement ùêµ:
                see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Bxx_general_logic/2_implication.txt
            - e. a combination of statement types a,b,c or d using combinators.

            remark:
                - Mathematics uses this highly restricted subset of statements to gain precision and remove ambiguity.
                - key statements:
                    - axioms:
                        see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/foundations_axiomatic_method.txt
                    - theorems:
                        see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/theorem.txt
                    - conjectures
                    - hypothesis

        - types(Epp, 2010:2):
            - universal
            - conditional
            - existential

            - universal: says that a certain property applies to all members of a set (Epp, 2010:2).
            - conditional: says that if one thing is true, then some other thing has to also be true (Epp, 2010:2).
            - existential: says that for a given property that may be true of false, there
                            exists at least one thing for which it is true (Epp, 2010:2).

            - universal conditional statement(Epp, 2010:3): are both universal and conditional
                can be rewritten to make universality or conditionally explicit and the other implicit.
                example:
                    for all animals a, if a is a dog, a is a mammal

                    explicit universal, implicit conditional:
                        for all dogs a, a is a mammal
                        all dogs are mammals
                    explicit conditional, implicit universal
                        if a is a dog, then a is a is mammal
                        if an animal is a dog, then it is a mammal

                example: rewriting universal conditional statement
                    for all real numbers x, if x is nonzero, x¬≤ is positive
                    - if a real number is nonzero, then its square is positive
                    - for all nonzero real numbers x, x¬≤ is positive
                    - if x, is nonzero real number, then x¬≤ is positive
                    - the square of any nonzero real number is positive
                    - all nonzero real numbers have positive squares

            - universal existential statement (Epp, 2010:3):
                states that a property is true for all objects
                    of a given type
                then
                    asserts the existence of something

                example:
                    every real number has an additive inverse

                    - universal part: every real number
                    - existential part: has an additive inverse

                example: rewrite universal existential statement
                    every pot has a lid
                    - all pots have a lid
                    - for all pots p, p has a lid
                    - for all pots p, there is a lid for p
                    - for all pots p, there is a lid l, such that l fits p
                        - for all pots p, there is a lid l, such that l is a lid for p

            - existential universal statement (Epp, 2010:4):
                asserts the existence of a certain object
                then
                    asserts that the object
                        satisfies a certain property
                        for all things of a certain kind
                example:
                    there is a positive integer,
                        that is less than or equal to every positive integer.

                    existential part: there is a positive integer
                    property: that is less than or equal to [property that the asserted object satisfies]
                    universal part:  every positive integer [the type of objects,
                                                                for which the asserted object
                                                                satisfies the property]

                    statement == true, because of the number 1

                    rewrites:
                        - some positive integer is less than or equal to every positive integer.
                        - there is a positive integer m, that is less than or equal to every positive integer.
                        - there is a positive integer m, such that every positive integer is greater or equal to m.
                        - there is a positive integer m, with the property that for all positive integers n,
                            m <= n

                example: rewrite below statement
                    There is a person in my class who is at least as old as every person in my class
                    - Some person in my class is a least as old as every person in my class.
                    - There is a person p in my class such that p is is at least as old as every person in my class.
                    - There is a person p in my class with the property that for every person q in my class,
                        p is at least as old as q.

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - there are important Mathematical concepts that require all three statement types to express.
            example:
                expressing the limit of a sequence (Epp, 2010:5):
                    if a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÉ, ... a‚Çô is a sequence of real numbers
                        the limit of a‚Çô as n approaches infinity L

                    for all positive real numbers œµ, there is an integer N such that
                    for all integers n, if n > N, then -œµ < a‚Çô - L < œµ
                    Question: we need to come back to this definition.

    - proof: none. it is a definition.

                        for all dogs a, a is a mammal
                        all dogs are mammals
                    explicit conditional, implicit universal
                        if a is a dog, then a is a is mammal
                        if an animal is a dog, then it is a mammal

                example: rewriting universal conditional statement
                    for all real numbers x, if x is nonzero, x¬≤ is positive
                    - if a real number is nonzero, then its square is positive
                    - for all nonzero real numbers x, x¬≤ is positive
                    - if x, is nonzero real number, then x¬≤ is positive
                    - the square of any nonzero real number is positive
                    - all nonzero real numbers have positive squares

            - universal existential statement (Epp, 2010:3):
                states that a property is true for all objects
                    of a given type

                    - existential part: has an additive inverse

                    - for all pots p, there is a lid for p
                    - for all pots p, there is a lid l, such that l fits p
                        - for all pots p, there is a lid l, such that l is a lid for p

            - existential universal statement (Epp, 2010:4):
                asserts the existence of a certain object
                then
                    asserts that the object
                        satisfies a certain property
                        for all things of a certain kind
                example:
