def foundations axiomatic method¹ (Kunen, 2007:5):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english:
        - Mathematics begins with/involves/uses the axiomatic method:
            1. we define/select axioms.
                - the justification for the axioms is part of the motivation or physics or philosophy NOT part of the Mathematics itself.
                    see: 00_general_and_overarching_topics;collections/00Axx_general_and_miscellaneous_specific_topics/00A30_philosophy_of_mathematics

            2. use logical deductions from the axioms to prove theorems.
                see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/0_mathematical_logic.txt

            3. construct natural numbers and other Mathematical structures.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - informal types of uses of the concept/word "axioms"(Kunen, 2007:47):
            - statements of faith:
                - statements that are obviously true, and thus require no proof.
                - closest to truism.

                - example:
                    Greek Classical View:
                        - make observations about Real Physical Space, which are obviously true.
                        - then from them, we can derive other non-obvious facts.

            - definitional axioms:
                - defines a useful class of structure.
                - captures the structure of things/ideas and proves theorems about them.
                    NB: One finds various instances of these things/ideas
                            in various domains.
                            domains = {Mathematics, Real Physical Space, Computation, ...}
                - common in abstract algebra

    - examples:
        - Geometry (Kunen, 2007:5):
            - these are definitional axioms.
                - they were statements of faith in Euclid's Geometry prior to Einstein's advances in Physics.
            - example:
                - Euclid Postulate(axiom) 1:
                    ∀x,y[Point(x) ∧ Point(y) ∧ x ≠ y] ⟹ ∃!z[Line(z) ∧ LiesOn(x,z) ∧ LiesOn(y,z)]
                        domain of discourse = all geometric objects.

                    english: any two distinct points
                                determine a unique line.

        - Group Theory (Kunen, 2007:6):
            - these are definitional axioms.
            - examples:
                - axioms of Groups define/captures what a Group is.
                    see: 20_group_theory_and_generalizations/1_group.txt

                - axioms of fields define/captures what a Field is:
                    see: 12_field_theory_and_polynomials/1_field.txt

        - Set Theory (Kunen, 2007:7):
            - these are definitional axioms.
            - based on Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice axiom (ZFC).
            - all of modern Mathematics is based on Set theory.

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
