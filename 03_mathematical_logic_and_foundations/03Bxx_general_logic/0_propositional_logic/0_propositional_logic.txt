def propositional logic | propositional calculus | sentential logic | sentential calculus | zeroth-order logic(Montalban, 2020):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: logic built ONLY with propositions.
            see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Bxx_general_logic/0_proposition.txt

    - plain english: logic built ONLY on with sentences that are either True or False.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - formal system:
            - language:
                - alphabet|symbols:
                    - variable symbols: {𝑎₁, 𝑎₂, 𝑎ₙ, ...}, used to represent propositions.
                    - punctuation symbols:
                        - (     = opening parenthesis
                        - )     = closing parenthesis

                    - logical connectives:
                        - ∧
                        - ∨
                        - ¬
                        - ⟹
                        - ⟺

                        see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/3_logical_connectives.txt

                        remark: it uses only a subset of all known logical connectives.

                - grammar:
                    - expression(formula): a string of the symbols above:
                        see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Bxx_general_logic/0_propositional_logic/1_string.txt

                        - types:
                            - well-formed formulas:
                                - every variable symbol
                                - if 𝛹 and 𝛷 are well-formed formulas, then the combinations below are well-formed too:
                                    - ¬𝛹
                                    - 𝛹 ∧ 𝛷
                                    - 𝛹 ∨ 𝛷
                                    - 𝛹 ⟹ 𝛷
                                    - 𝛹 ⟺ 𝛷
                                    - ...

                                - examples:
                                    - 𝑎₁
                                    - 𝑎₁ ∧ 𝑎₂
                                    - 𝑎₁ ⟹ 𝑎₃
                                    - (𝑎₂ ⟺ 𝑎₅)
                                    - (𝑎₄ ⟹ 𝑎₆) ⟺ (a₁ ⟹ 𝑎₉) ∧ ¬𝑎₃
                                    - ...

                            - malformed formulas:
                                - examples:
                                    - ((⟹¬𝑎₁
                                    - ¬(⟺𝑎₂
                                    - ...
            - axioms: ???
            - rules of inference: ???

    - examples:
        - If dumbo is pink, pigs can fly:
            let:
                𝑝 = dumbo is pink
                𝑞 = pigs can fly
            then:
                𝑝 ⟹ 𝑞, is the sentential logic formal representation.

    - use cases:
        - electronic circuit design
        - computer science
        - ...

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
