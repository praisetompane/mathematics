def propositional logic or propositional calculus or sentential logic or sentential calculus or zeroth-order logic(Montalban, 2020):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: logic built ONLY with propositions.
            see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Bxx_general_logic/0_proposition.txt

    - plain english: logic built ONLY on with sentence that can be either True or False.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - formal language for sentential logic:
            - symbols:
                - variable symbols: {a₁, p, q, z, ...}
                - grammar symbols:
                    - (     = Opening parenthesis
                    - )     = closing parenthesis

                - logical connectives:
                    - ∧     
                    - ∨     
                    - ¬    
                    - ⟹    
                    - ⟺ 
                    see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/logical_connectives.txt
                    NB: it uses a subset of all known logical connectives.

            - grammar:
                - 

            see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/1_formal_system.txt

        - expressions: list of strings

        - formula: sequence of symbols
            - types:
                - well-formed formulas:
                    - variable symbols

                    - examples:
                        - 𝑎₁ 
                        - 𝑢
                        - 𝑝 ⟹ 𝑞 
                        - (𝑦 ⟺ 𝑧) ∧ 𝑞
                        - (𝑏 ⟹ 𝑎) ⟺ (𝑡 ⟹ 𝑞) ∧ (¬𝑐)
                        - ...

                - malformed formulas:
                    - examples:
                        - ((⟹¬𝑝
                        - ¬(⟺𝑞
                        - ...

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - electronic circuit design
        - computer science
        - ...
        
    - proof: none. it is a definition.
