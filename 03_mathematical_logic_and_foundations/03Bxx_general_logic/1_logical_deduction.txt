def inference rule | logical deduction(Demaine, Abel, Chapman, 20024):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: a rule for combining true propositions, to for other true propositions.

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: the rules we use move from one true statement to another true statement in our proof.

    - properties:
        - rules of inference per logic:
            - zeroth-order logic:
                - modus ponens
                - modus tollens | modus tollendo tollens
                - hypothetical syllogism
                - ...
            - first-order logic:
                - universal instantiation
                - existential generalization
                - ...

    - examples: ??

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: ???
