def axiom(Leighton, 2010):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: a statement that is assumed to be True.
        remark: There is no proof it is True.
            Greek etymology := to think worth
            ∴ Something we deem worthy to be True

    - properties of a set of axioms:
        - consistent: no statement can be proved to be BOTH True AND False
        - complete: can be used to prove that every statement is either True OR False

        NB: Gödel's incompleteness theorems
            There is NO set of axioms that is BOTH consistent AND complete

            consistency is a MUST, something cannot be BOTH True AND False
            ∴ if we want consistency in a given set of axioms,
                there will be True facts that we will never be able to prove True or False
