def ⟹ | implication(Devlin, 2013):

    - formal: conditional(material conditional) + causation:

            - conditional:
                let:
                    T := True
                    F := False
                    ϕ be a proposition
                    ψ be a proposition
                then:
                    ϕ ⟹ ψ is defined as:
                        ϕ   ψ   ϕ ⟹ ψ
                        T   T     T
                        T   F     F
                        F   T     T
                        F   F     T

                        and,
                            ϕ is the antecedent
                            ψ is the consequent

                remark:
                    - we define the conditional entirely based on truth values on the antecedent and the consequent.
                    - we define/choose the meaning of the word 'implies' for the Mathematical context.
                        The same way you would choose the meaning of keyword in any formal language(e.g. a programming language).

                    - NB: This gives us an 𝘢𝘭𝘸𝘢𝘺𝘴 defined notion that is equivalent to 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭 implication,
                                when a TRUE/meaningful implication exists between ϕ and ψ.

                    - ϕ ⟹ ψ is always equivalent to ¬ϕ ∨ ψ

            - causation: the antecedent MUST cause the consequent.
                remark: NB: not considered nor used in Mathematics, it is left to Philosophy.

        - in words:
            - conditional:
                a binary operator from truth values to a single truth value,
                    according to the rules below
                        if ϕ is True  and ψ is True,   then ϕ implies ψ is/returns True
                        if ϕ is True  and ψ is False,  then ϕ implies ψ is/returns False
                        if ϕ is False and ψ is True,   then ϕ implies ψ is/returns True
                        if ϕ is False and ψ is False,  then ϕ implies ψ is/returns True

    - plain english: an implication ϕ ⟹ ψ is True,
                        when ϕ is False OR ψ is True.

        NB: False implies anything is True

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - conditional:
            - properties:
                - why|how the conditional can correctly represent implication(conditional + causation):
                    let:
                        ϕ be a proposition
                        ψ be a proposition
                        a true implication(i.e. causal relationship exists from ϕ to ψ)
                    then:
                        the TRUTH value of the conditional ϕ ⟹ ψ, behaves in a way that ϕ causes ψ?

        - causation: N/A for Mathematics.

    - examples:
        - (Leighton, 2010):
            let:
                ϕ = 𝑛 >= 2
                ψ = 𝑛² >= 4
                ∀ₙ ∈ ℤ, ϕ ⟹ ψ
                ∴ ∀ₙ ∈ ℤ, 𝑛 >= 2 ⟹ 𝑛² >= 4
            then:
                        ϕ               ψ
                𝑛       𝑛 => 2         n² >= 4                   T/F
                ------------------------------------------------------------
                0         F            0² >= 4                    T     **??
                1         F            1² >= 4                    T     **??
                2         T            2² >= 4 := T               T
                3         T            3² >= 4 := T               T
                4         T            4² >= 4 := T               T
                .
                .
                .
                10        T            10² >= 4 := T              T

                ∀ₙ ∈ {0,1}, 𝑛² ̸>= 4
                ∴ False

    - use cases:
        - mechanism in Mathematics to prove propositions from axioms or theorems(Devlin, 2013).

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
