def predicate: a proposition whose TRUTH 
                depends on the value of one or more variable(s) (Leighton, 2010).
                i.e. we cannot determine whether it is True or False, 
                        until n's value is known.
                example:
                        n is a perfect square.
                        common notation: 
                                P(n) ::= n is a perfect square.
                                P(4) is True
                                P(5) is False
                                âˆ´ P(n) is False
