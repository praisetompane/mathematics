def predicate(Leighton, 2010):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: a proposition whose TRUTH
                    depends on the value of one or more variable(s) (Leighton, 2010).
                    i.e. we cannot determine whether it is True or False,
                            until variable(s) value is known.

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples:
        - 𝑛 is a perfect square.
            𝑃(𝑛) ::= 𝑛 is a perfect square.
            𝑃(4) is True
            𝑃(5) is False
            ∴ 𝑃(𝑛) is False

    - use cases:

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
