def foundations numbers method(Wildberger, 2009):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english:
        - Mathematics begins with a blank/empty space(i.e. nothing):
            1. in it we introduce the following:
                1. "|":
                    | represents a single entity:
                            we name | as one
                        NB: this can be any symbol(i.e. *, -, ., etc)

                2. the idea of adding one(i.e."|") to itself:
                    - | and | = ||
                        we name || as two

                3. iterate: the idea of adding | to what we already have:
                    - examples:
                        || and |:
                            we name ||| as three

                        ||| and |:
                            we name |||| as four

                        |||| and |:
                            we name ||||| as five
                        ...

            2. construct natural numbers and other Mathematical structures.

                        - specifically (Wildberger, 2009) definition.

                Question: do we require natural language to create Mathematics?
                    ans: Yes. Mathematics uses a restricted subset of natural language(Devlin, 2012:28)
                        see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/0_mathematical_logic.txt

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
