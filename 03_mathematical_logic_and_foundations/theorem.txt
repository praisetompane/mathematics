def theorem(Censor, 2013):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: a mathematical fact that is proved.

    - plain english: a sentence
                    that is proved to be true.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: 
        - structure:
            - context/assumptions/setting/data
                e.g. let, suppose
            
            - conclusion/consequence/result
                e.g. Then some thing is True/ Therefore some thing is True
                
                NB: This is what requires proof.
            examples:
                /26_real_functions/theorems

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - building block for Mathematical theories(i.e. fields)
        
    - proof: N/A
