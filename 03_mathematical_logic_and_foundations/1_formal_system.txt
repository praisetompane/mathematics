def formal system(Montalban, 2020):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: context to develop Mathematics in a formal way.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - language
        - rules of inference
        - axioms

        - language: the means to create Mathematical statements:
            - symbols
            - grammar

            - symbols: any printable(i.e. we can see) character.
                examples: { 0, 1, ×, +, ∈, ∨, ∧, ∃, ∀, (), ... }

                - vocabulary:
                    0               := zero
                    1               := one
                    +               := plus
                    ×               := times
                    x,y,z ...       := variable symbols

                    NB: variable, we can add or remove depending on the objects we want to work with.

                - punctuation symbols:
                    - (             := opening parenthesis
                    - )             := closing parenthesis

                - logical symbols:
                    =               := equality
                    ∧               := and
                    ∨               := or
                    ¬               := not
                    ∃               := exists
                    ∀               := forall
                    ∈               := belongs

                NB: fixed in all first-order logic.

            - grammar: how you can put the symbols together:
                - ...
            NB: The language is complete: You can express every Mathematical statement with the language.

        - rules of inference: set of allowed logical steps:
            - ...

            NB: The rules are complete: You can formalize all arguments in Mathematics with the rules.

        - axioms: set of basic Mathematical statements
                        presumed to be true
                            in this system.

            NB: The axioms are incomplete.

        NB: Gödel proved the completeness and incompleteness theorems.

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - create a solid foundation for Mathematics to:
            - avoid paradoxes.
            - ...
        - formal systems can be studied in logic as Mathematical objects which allows:
            - studying Mathematics(proofs, theorems, etc) using Mathematics (i.e. meta-Mathematics)
                example: Gödel's theorems.
        - computers can manipulate formal symbols which allows:
            - mathematical proof verification using computer.
            - computer aided mathematical proof development.
            - computer program verification and proof of properties(accuracy, etc).

    - proof: ???
