def formal system(Montalban, 2020):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: context to develop Mathematics in a formal way.

    - intuition: ???
            
    - properties:
        - language
        - rules
        - axioms
        
        - def language: the means to create Mathematical statements.
            - components:
                - symbols
                - grammar

                def symbols: any printable(i.e. we can see) character.
                    examples: { 0, 1, ×, +, ∈, ∨, ∧, ∃, ∀, (), ... }

                    def vocabulary:
                        0               := zero
                        1               := one
                        +               := plus
                        ×               := times
                        ∈               := belongs

                        NB: variable, we can add or remove depending on the objects we want to work with.

                    def logical symbols:
                        =               := equality
                        ∧               := and
                        ∨               := or
                        ¬               := not
                        ∃               := exists
                        ∀               := forall
                        x,y,z ...       := variable symbols
                        (,)             := parenthesis

                        NB: fixed in all first-order logic.

                def grammar: how you can put the symbols together:
                    - ...
            NB: The language is complete: You can express every Mathematical statement with the language.

        - def rules: set of allowed logical steps:
            - ...

            NB: The rules are complete: You can formalize all arguments in Mathematics with the rules.

        - def axioms: set of basic Mathematical statements
                        presumed to be true
                            in this system.

            NB: The axioms are incomplete.

        NB: Gödel proved the completeness and incompleteness theorems.

    - examples: ???
    
    - use cases:
        - create a solid foundation for Mathematics to:
            - avoid paradoxes.
            - ...
        - formal systems can be studied in logic as Mathematical objects which allows:
            - studying Mathematics(proofs, theorems, etc) using Mathematics (i.e. meta-Mathematics)
                example: Gödel's theorems.
        - computers can manipulate formal symbols which allows:
            - mathematical proof verification using computer.
            - computer aided mathematical proof development.
            - computer program verification and proof of properties(accuracy, etc).

    - proof: ???
