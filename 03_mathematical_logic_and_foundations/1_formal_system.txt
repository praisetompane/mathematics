def formal system(Montalban, 2020):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - language: the means to create Mathematical statements:

            - properties:
                - alphabet|symbols: valid characters(alphabet|symbols) in the language:

                    - vocabulary alphabet|symbols:
                        0           := zero
                        1           := one
                        +           := plus
                        √ó           := times
                        ‚àà           := belongs
                        ùë•,ùë¶,ùëß,...   := variable alphabet
                        ...         := any other symbols needed for that specific formal system

                        - properties:
                            - they can vary per formal system.

                    - logical alphabet|symbols:
                        see:
                            - 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Bxx_general_logic/5_0_logical_connectives.txt
                            - 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Bxx_general_logic/6_quantifiers.txt

                        punctuation alphabet|symbols:
                            (           := opening parenthesis
                            )           := closing parenthesis

                        - properties:
                            - they can vary per formal system.

                - grammar: valid ways to compose(put together) the alphabet|symbols:
                    - ...

                - the language is complete: you can express all Mathematical statements with the language.
                    remark: G√∂del proved this, in the completeness theorem.

        - rules of inference: valid logical steps:
            see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Bxx_general_logic/4_logical_deduction.txt

            - properties:
                - the rules are complete: you can prove all Mathematical statements with the rules.
                    remark: G√∂del proved this, in the completeness theorem.
                - they can vary per formal system.

        - axioms: basic Mathematical statements, presumed to be true:
            see: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Bxx_general_logic/2_axiom.txt

            - properties:
                - the axioms are incomplete.
                    remark: G√∂del proved this, in the incompleteness theorem.
                - they can vary per formal system
                    - example:

                        - 12_field_theory_and_polynomials/0_field_theory.txt

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - context to develop Mathematics in a formal way to:
            - avoid paradoxes.
            - ...
        - formal systems can be studied in logic as Mathematical objects which allows:
            - studying Mathematics(proofs, theorems, etc) using Mathematics (i.e. meta-Mathematics)
                example: G√∂del's theorems.
        - computers can manipulate formal systems which allows:
            - mathematical proof verification using computers.
            - computer aided mathematical proof development.
            - computer program verification and proof of properties(accuracy, etc).

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
