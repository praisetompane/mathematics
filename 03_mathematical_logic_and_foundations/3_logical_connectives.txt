def logical connectives or logical operator | sentential connective | sentential operator | combinators(Kunen, 2007:4) (Weisstein):

    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - names:
            - ∧  = and | conjunction |
            - ∨  = or  | disjunction | inclusive disjunction
            - ¬  = not | negation
            - ⟹ = implies
                intuition:
                    - if 𝑎 is True, then 𝑏 is True
                    - if the first predicate is True, then next is ALSO True.
                    - False implies anything is True, because there is NO contradiction:
                        - F ⟹ T = T
                        - F ⟹ F = T

            - ⟺ = if and only if(iff) | equivalence
                intuition:
                    - it is a bidirectional implication(i.e. the implies defined).
                        - the truth value of both predicates have to be the same, then the ⟺ is True:
                            - T ⟺ T = T
                            - F ⟺ F = F

        - truth table evaluation(Kunen, 2007:4):
            def T: True
            def F: False

            φ   ψ   φ ∨ ψ    φ ∧ ψ      φ ⟹ ψ   φ ⟺ ψ
            T   T   T        T          T        T
            T   F   T        F          F        F
            F   T   T        F          T        F
            F   F   F        F          T        T

            φ   ¬φ
            T   F
            F   T

            NB: φ ⟹ ψ is always equivalent to ¬φ ∨ ψ

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
