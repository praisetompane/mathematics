def mathematical logic | formal logic:
    - formal: ???
        - in words:
            - the mathematically formal study of the language(terms and statements) and reasoning used in Mathematics(Devlin, 2012:28):
                see:
                    - statements: 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/2_statement.txt
                    - terms:
                        - 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/3_logical_connectives.txt
                        - 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/4_quantifiers.txt

                - provides the universally accepted meanings of the language terms.
                - analyzes the behaviour of the language terms.

            - defines the syntax and semantics of statements(2007:6-7).

            - studies how to reliably get to conclusions, from assumptions(i.e. axioms)(Ben-David, 2015)

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: the formal study of Mathematical language?

    - properties: ???

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - develop the foundations for Mathematics using formal systems(Montalban, 2020).
            see:
                - 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/1_formal_system.txt
                - 03_mathematical_logic_and_foundations/03Bxx_general_logic/1_first_order_logic/0_first_order_logic.txt

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
