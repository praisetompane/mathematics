def mathematical logic (Montalban, 2020):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english: studies the foundations of logic and formal systems.
                    goals:
                        - develop the foundations of mathematics using formal systems.

    - intuition: ???

    - defines these objects (Kunen, 2007:6-7):
        def mathematical proof:

        def mathematical statement:

        def syntax:

        def semantics: involves meaning or 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠 such as groups.

        def Completeness Theorem:
            - relates syntax and semantics

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???
        
    - proof: ???

NB: every list of formal sentences
        forms the axioms of some axiomatic theory (Kunen, 2007:7).
