Vectors

  An entity with a MAGNITUDE and DIRECTION

  Addition and Subtraction: Add/Substract corresponding components

    Why does the order of terms matter in addition and substration?

      (a) - (b) != (b) - (a)
      (a) +  (b) != (b) + (a)

  Multiplication/Division:



  UNIT VECTORS

    A vector with a magnitude of 1

    Getting the Unit Vector of another vector (Vector in the same direction with
    a magnitude of 1)

    1. Divide the Components of the vector by the magnitude of the vector

        a = (3,4)
        ||a|| = 5
        {
           sqrt(3^2 + 4 ^2)
           sqrt(9 + 16)
           sqrt(25)
           = 5
           :Apply pythagoras theorem
        }

        u = (3/5, 4/5) : (Out unit vector)

        Proof(Get Magnitude using Pythagoras therem)

       ||u||=
       {
          sqrt( (3/5)^2 + (4/5)^2 )
          sqrt( 9/25 + 16/ 25)
          sqrt(25/25)
          sqrt(1) = 1 : Correct
       }
