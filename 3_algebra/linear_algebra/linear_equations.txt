name:
    linear equations of one variable
    first degree equationss of one variable
    def:
        equation with 1 as the hightest exponent(degree)
        
def solve: find a value(s) of the variable(s) that satfisfies the equation.
        def satfisfies: make the Left Hand Side(LHS) equal Right Hand Side(RHS)

methods to solve:
    - inverse operations
    - transpose

    - inverse operations
        - group like terms by removing them using inverse operations.
        Example:
            x + 1 = 10:
                x + 1 -1 = 10 - 1
                apply inverse of 1(i.e. -1) to both LHS and RHS.

            3x - 20 = 10 - 5x:

                3x - 20 + 20 = 10 - 5x + 20
                3x = 10 - 5x
                3x + 5x = 10
                8x = 10

                1/8(8x/1) = 10(1/8)
                8x/8 = 10/8
                x = 5/4

    - transpose
        rules:

            addition ---transposes to-------> subtraction
            subtraction ---transposes to------->addition
            multiplication ---transposes to------->division
            division ---transposes to-------> multiplication

        Examples:
            addition ---transposes to-------> subtraction
                x + 1 = 10:
                x = -1

            subtraction ---transposes to-------> addition

                x - 20 = 10:
                x = 10 + 20
                x = 30
            
            multiplication ---transposes to-------> division
                5x + 20 = 90:
                x + 20 = 90/5
                x + 20 = 45
                x = 45 - 20
                x = 25

            division ---transposes to-------> multiplication
                x/30 + 60 = 70
                x + 60 = 70(10)
                x + 60 = 700
                x = 700 - 60
                x = 640
                âˆ´ no solution? Q: I made ths equation, it this possible?
