def¹ group: a pair of a set 𝐺 and an operation ◦ (𝐺, ◦), is a group if
    it satisfies the axioms below (Censor, 2015).

def² group: a 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 (𝐺, ∘) for the axioms 𝐺𝑃 = {γ₁, γ₂, γ₃, γ₄} (Kunen, 2007:5).

𝐺𝑃: axioms (Censor, 2015):
    - γ₁:  closure: ∀𝑎,𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, 𝑎◦𝑏 ∈ 𝐺
                for any elements 𝑎 and 𝑏 of 𝐺
                    the results of applying operation ◦ 
                        on 𝑎 and 𝑏  
                            is an element of 𝐺

    - γ₂: associativity: ∀𝑎,𝑏,𝑐, (𝑎◦𝑏)◦𝑐 = 𝑎◦(𝑏◦𝑐)
                for any elements 𝑎,𝑏 and 𝑐 of 𝐺
                    the order of applying operation ◦
                        on 𝑎,𝑏 and 𝑐 produces 
                            the same result

    - γ₃: identity: ∃𝑒 ∈ 𝐺 such that ∀𝑎 ∈ 𝐺, 𝑎 ◦ 𝑒 = 𝑎
                for any element a of 𝐺
                    there exists an element 𝑒 of 𝐺
                        such that when operation ◦ is applied to 𝑎 and 𝑒 
                            the result is 𝑎

    - γ₄: inverse: ∀ 𝑎 ∈ 𝐺, ∃ 𝑏 ∈ 𝐺, such that 𝑎 ◦ 𝑏 = 𝑒
                for any element 𝑎 of 𝐺
                    there exists an 𝑏 of 𝐺
                        such that when operation ◦ is applied to 𝑎 and 𝑏 
                            the result is e(i.e. the identity of the group 𝐺)

def Abelian or commutative group:
    group (𝐺,◦) is commutative/Abelian
        if it satisfies the Group definition axiom and axiom below (Censor, 2015):

    axiom:
        commutativity:  ∀𝑎,𝑏, 𝑎◦𝑏 = 𝑏◦𝑎
            for any element 𝑎 and 𝑏 of 𝐺
                swapping 𝑎 and 𝑏 order
                    when applying operation ◦
                        produces the same result
