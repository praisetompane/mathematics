def abstraction: extraction of the properties
                    of a concrete structure 
                        to reveal its abstract structure (Censor, 2015).
            abstract structure = the set of properties

given an understanding of the abstract structure
    we can understand at once 
        anything that has this abstract structure(Censor, 2015).
