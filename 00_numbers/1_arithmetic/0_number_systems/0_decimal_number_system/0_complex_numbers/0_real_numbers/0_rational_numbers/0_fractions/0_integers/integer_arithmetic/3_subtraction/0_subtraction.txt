            - General Integer Subtraction algorithm (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:15).
                1. Identify that is a subtraction
                2. Identify the numbers being subtracted (minuend[RHS] and subtrahend[LHS])
                3.
                    - Leave the minuend unchanged
                    - ADD the opposite of the subtrahend
                4. Follow the rules of addition

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - minuend: the number from which another will be subtracted (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:13).

        - subtrahend: the number to be subtracted from another (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:14).

        - Models | Metaphors to understand the MEANING of subtraction:
            - Climbing steps (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:14)
                3 - 2: Walk 3 steps up, then 2 steps down

            - Adding negative-positive pairs(which are equivalent to zero) to have enough value to cancel out the subtrahend (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:14).

                        - subtrahend is actually 4, as it is the negative value, even though it is the first term
                            Add the 6 P
                            4 P cancel out 4 N

                remarks:
                    - Subtracting a negative number(e.g. -6) is equivalent to adding the opposite of that number(e.g. 6)²
                        -4 - (-6) = -4 + 6 = 2

                        abstractly:
                            given:
                                𝑎 - (-𝑏)
                            then:
                                𝑎 - 1(-𝑏)
                                𝑎 -1 × -𝑏
                                𝑎 +𝑏
                                𝑎 + 𝑏

                    - If there is negative term(even if adding), you are going to subtract (i.e. -A + B)

def substration²: MYINC:
    the opposite of addition
        the act of removing quantity from a place value(i.e. ...,the hundreds ,the tens, the ones, the tenths, the hundredths,...)
            during this act:
                if the quantity to remove exceeds the quantity in the current place value
                    we convert 1(one) quantity of the next higher place, into the current place value
                        the conversion = the 1(one) quantity * base of the number system(often 10) +
                                        quantity in current place value
