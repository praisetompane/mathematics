exercise set 1.1.(Epp, 2010:6):
    rewrites:
        1. Is there a real number whose square is -1?
            a. Is there a real number x such that xÂ² = -1
            b. Does there exist a real number x such that xÂ² = -1
            
        2. Is there an integer that has a remainder 2 when it is divided by 5
            and a remainder of 3 when it is divided by 6?
            a. Is there an integer n such that n has as remainder of 2 when divided by 5
                and a remainder of 3 when it is divided by 6
            b. Does there exist an integer n such that if n is divided by 5 the
                remainder is 2 and if divided by 6 the remainder is 3

        3. Given any two real numbers, there is a real number in between
            a. Given any real numbers a and b, there is a real number c
                such that c is greater than a and less than b.
            b. For any two real numbers a and b, there exists a real number c
                such that a < c < b.

        4. Given any real number, there  is a real number that is greater.
