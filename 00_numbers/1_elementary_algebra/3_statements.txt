kinds(Epp, 2010:2):
    * universal
    * conditional
    * existential

    def:
        * universal: says that a certain property applies to all members of a set (Epp, 2010:2).
        * conditional: says that if one thing is true, then some other thing has to also be true (Epp, 2010:2).
        * existential: says that for a given property that may be true of false, there
                        exists at least one thing for which it is true (Epp, 2010:2).

        * universal conditional statement: are both universal and conditional
            can be rewritten to make universality or conditionally explicit and the other implicit (Epp, 2010:3).
            example:
                for all animals a, if a is a dog, a is a mammal

                explicit universal, implicit conditional:
                    for all dogs a, a is a mammal
                    all dogs are mammals
                explicit conditional, implicit universal
                    if a is a dog, then a is a is mammal
                    if an animal is a dog, then it is a mammal

            example: rewriting universal conditional statement
                for all real numbers x, if x is nonzero, x² is positive
                - if a real number is nonzero, then its square is positive 
                - for all nonzero real numbers x, x² is positive
                - if x, is nonzero real number, then x² is positive
                - the square of any nonzero real number is positive
                - all nonzero real numbers have positive squares

        * universal existential statement (Epp, 2010:3):
            states that a property is true for all objects 
                of a given type
            then
                asserts the existence of something
            
            example:
                every real number has an additive inverse

                - universal part: every real number
                - existential part: has an additive inverse

            example: rewrite universal existential statement
                every pot has a lid
                - all pots have a lid
                - for all pots p, p has a lid
                - for all pots p, there is a lid for p
                - for all pots p, there is a lid l, such that l fits p
                    - for all pots p, there is a lid l, such that l is a lid for p

        * existential universal statement (Epp, 2010:4): 
            asserts the existence of a certain object
            then    
                asserts that the object
                    satisfies a certain property
                    for all things of a certain kind
            example:
                there is a positive integer, 
                    that is less than or equal to every positive integer.

                existential part: there is a positive integer
                property: that is less than or equal to [property that the asserted object satisfies]
                universal part:  every positive integer [the type of objects, 
                                                            for which the asserted object
                                                            satisfies the property]

                statement == true, because of the number 1
            
                rewrites:
                    - some positive integer is less than or equal to every positive integer.
                    - there is a positive integer m, that is less than or equal to every positive integer.
                    - there is a positive integer m, such that every positive integer is greater or equal to m.
                    - there is a positive integer m, with the property that for all positive integers n,
                        m <= n
            
            example: rewrite below statement
                There is a person in my class who is at least as old as every person in my class
                - Some person in my class is a least as old as every person in my class.
                - There is a person p in my class such that p is is at least as old as every person in my class.
                - There is a person p in my class with the property that for every person q in my class,
                    p is at least as old as q.

NB: there are important Mathematical concepts that require all three statement types to express.

    expressing the limit of a sequence (Epp, 2010:5):
        if a₁, a₂, a₃, ... aₙ is a sequence of real numbers
            the limit of aₙ as n approaches infinity L
        
        for all positive real numbers ϵ, there is an integer N such that
        for all integers n, if n > N, then -ϵ < aₙ - L < ϵ
        Q: we need to come back to this definition.
