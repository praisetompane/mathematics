def slope (Khan Academy):
    - formal: 
        Δ𝑦/Δ𝑥
    
    - plain english:
        - how much change
            happens in 𝑦
                for a change in 𝑥
            NB: It is a ratio of the change in y with respect to/proportional to the change in 𝑥.
            Question: f(Δx) -> Δy
                is slope a function 𝑓, from a Δ in 𝑥 to a Δ in y?: No, it is a ratio.

        - how steep a line is.
        - how quickly does it increase
        - how quickly does it decrease
