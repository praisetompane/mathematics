def algebra²(Censor, 2015): 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: a field in Mathematics in which we perform calculations with things that are not necessarily(i.e. not always) numbers.

    - intuition:

    - properties:

    - examples:
        - 𝑎𝑥² + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0
            this is a calculation that has variables(x), parameters(a,b) and a number(0)
        - 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 
            this is a calculation that has variables(y, x) and parameter(m)
    - use cases:


def symmetry(Frenkel):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???
        
    transformations that preserve
        shape and position of an object.
    - examples:
        - sphere: ∞ symmetries
        - square: 90°, 180°, 270°, 360° rotations.
