def algebra²(Censor, 2015):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: a field in Mathematics in which we perform calculations with things that are not necessarily(i.e. not always) numbers.

    - intuition:

    - properties:

    - examples:
        - 𝑎𝑥² + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0
            this is a calculation that has variables(x), parameters(a,b) and a number(0)
        - 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥
            this is a calculation that has variables(y, x) and parameter(m)
    - use cases:

def algebra³(Devlin, 2012):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: a field in which we reason logically about numbers, as opposed to calculating with numbers(i.e. arithmetic).
           see: 00_numbers/1_arithmetic.txt

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: generalization of arithmetic?

    - properties: ???

    - use cases: ???

def algebra (Al-Samawal al-Maghribi) Devlin, 2012):
    - formal: ???

        - in words:
