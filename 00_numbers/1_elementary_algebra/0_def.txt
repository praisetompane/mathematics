    - plain english: a field in Mathematics in which we perform calculations with things that are not necessarily(i.e. not always) numbers.

    - intuition:

    - properties:

    - examples:
        - 𝑎𝑥² + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0
            this is a calculation that has variables(x), parameters(a,b) and a number(0)
        - 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 
            this is a calculation that has variables(y, x) and parameter(m)
    - use cases:
    
def expression:
    a sentence

    types:
        numerical expression
        algebraic expression

    numerical expression
        1 + 1
    
    algebraic expression:
        x + 1

def equation:
    a sentence that equates two sides

    algebraic equation: Question: Do we have non algebraic equations?
        5x + 1 = 10

        names of parts:
            5x + 1  = LHS
            10      = RHS
            x       = variable
            {1, 10} = constant(s)
            +       = operator
