def variable¹(Epp, 2010:1-2): 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english:
        placeholders for when:
            - you want to talk about something and imagine it has more than one value
                BUT do not know all the possible values .
            - you want to make assertions about it that are true for all elements in a given set (Epp, 2010:2).

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples:
        - Are there numbers with the property that the sum of their squares equals the square of their sum?
            - are there numbers a, b such that a² + b² = (a + b)² ?
            - are there numbers a₁, a₂, a₃, ...aₙ such that 
                a₁² + a₂² + a₃² + ... + aₙ² = (a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₙ)²? 
        
        - Given any real number, its square is non negative (Epp, 2010:2). 
            - for all real numbers n, n² >= 0
            - for any real number n, n² >= 0
