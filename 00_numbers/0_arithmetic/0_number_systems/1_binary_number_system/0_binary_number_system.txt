        - in words: base(radix)-2 positional numeral system for representing numbers (Khan Academy):
            Question: Are all sets of numbers representable?
            digits = {0, 1}

                ... 3       2       1      0    : places/positions, P
                    8s      4s      2s     1s   : place's/position's value
                    2³      2²      2¹     2⁰   : 2ⁿ | n ∈ P : each place represents a power of 2, hence base 2.

            example:
                900:
                    9       8       7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0
                    1       1       1       0       0       0       0       1       0       0
                    2⁹*1    2⁸*1    2⁷*1    2⁶*0    2⁵*0    2⁴*0    2³*0    2²*1    2¹*0    2⁰*0
                    512*1   256*1   128*1   64*0    32*0    16*0    8*0     4*1     2*0     1*0
                    512     256     128     64      32      16      8       4       0       1
                    512 +   256 +   128 +   64  +   32  +   16  +   8   +   4   +   0   +   1 = 900

    - plain english: a number system that uses 2 unique symbols to represent numbers.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - binary number patterns (Khan Academy):
            * numbers with last bit on are odd
                i.e. any number + 1 is odd
                Question: any number, including complex numbers?
            * given number of bits 𝑛,
                we can determine the maximum representable number
                    formulaic: 2ⁿ - 1
                        Question: can we prove this ∀ numbers?
                    representation = all bit set to 1

                    example:
                        n = 4
                        formulaic solution: 2⁴ - 1 = 15

                        representation:
                            3       2       1       0
                            1       1       1       1
                            2³*1    2²*1    2¹*1    2⁰*1
                            8*1     4*1     2*1     1*1
                            8       4       2       1
                            8   +   4   +   2   +   1 = 15
