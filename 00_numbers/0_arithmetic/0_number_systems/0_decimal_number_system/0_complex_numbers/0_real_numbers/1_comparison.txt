    - plain english: 
      when comparing Real Numbers, the number most left on the number line is the lesser of the two.
        Examples:
          -5 < -4 = True
            How?
              Given:
                -5 of "some things"
                Acquire 1 of those "some things"
                  Then
                    You have -4 of "some things".
                    Getting 1 more of "some things" get yous to -4 of "some things"
                    ∴ -4 > -5
              Because -4 is further to the Right on the number line than -5
                      -5 is further to the Left on the number line than -4

          4.23 < 4.2 = False
            How?
              4.23 is further to the Right on the number line(by 0.03 units)
                headed closer 4.3, which is greater that 4.2

          -10 >= -11 = True
            Because -10 is further to the Right on the number line
                    -11 is further to the Left on the number line

          7.01 < 7.1 = True
            Because 7.1 is further to the Right on the number line
                    7.01 is further to the Left on the number line

          Given:
            you owe $4
            your friend owes $3
          Then:
            you have a larger debt than your friend.
            ∴ you have "less" money [Assuming you have the same total money]

        Something Interesting:
          Equality in the Set of Negative numbers(ℝ⁻) is opposite to Equality in the Set of Positive numbers(ℝ⁺).
          Question: can we prove this for all Real Numbers?
          Question: Does this apply to Complex Numbers?

            Examples:
              Positives                 Negatives
                4 < 5 = True              -4 < -5 = False
                6 > 7 = False             -6 > -7 = True
                10 >= 100 = False         -10 >= -100 = True

        Something Interesting:
          Given two Negative numbers
            The number with a greater absolute value is less than the other

          Examples:
            -4 and -5
              |-4| = 4, |-5| = 5

              5 > 4
              ∴ -5 < -4

            -71.24 and -71.2
              |-71.24| = 71.24, |-71.2| = 71.2

              71.24 > 71.2
              ∴ -71.24 < 71.2

        Something Interesting:
          with < and  >, the mouth of sign always eats the big number (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:5).

        Something Interesting:
          The "value" of a number is determined by its position on the number line.
            Then its position on the number line determines whether it is <,=,> than other numbers
