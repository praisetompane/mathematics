    - plain english: a field in Mathematics in which we perform calculations with numbers.

                    - fundamental lows of arithmetic:
                        let:
                            𝑎,𝑏,𝑐 ∈ ℕ
                        then:
                            1. commutativity of addition                     : 𝑎 + 𝑏 = 𝑏 + 𝑎
                            2. commutativity of multiplication               : 𝑎 × 𝑏 = 𝑏 × 𝑎
                            3. associativity of addition                     : 𝑎 + (𝑏 + 𝑐) = (𝑎 + 𝑏) + 𝑐
                            4. associativity of multiplication               : 𝑎 × (𝑏 × 𝑐) = (𝑎 × 𝑏) × 𝑐
                            5. distributivity of addition and multiplication : 𝑎 × (𝑏 + 𝑐) = 𝑎×𝑏 + 𝑎×𝑐
