number vs numeral(Hamkins, 2020)
    example:
        number = fifty seven
        numerals:
            57 - decimal(base 10)
            111001 - binary
            LVII - roman numerals

Qs:
    Q: Where/When did give these quantities names?
    Q: Why do we count?
    Q: When did we start counting?
    Q: Did we always count upto ten as homo sapiens?
        hence base 10 system so natural?

    Q: Where does the idea of "how many" things are there come from?
    Q: Humans and other animals show case the ability to "know(by way of counting? Are there other ways to know how many things are there?" "how many" things are there.
    Q: how many = numbers?
    Q: does number theory tackle the origin of concept of "how many"?
    Q: what is a number?
    Q: what is counting?
