def i:
    formal:
        Let i = √-1 (Censor, 2015).
                ∴ i² = -1
    plain english:
        define a new number "i"
            whose value is the square root of -1.

        NB: This number does not exist in the Real numbers.
            There is no number you can square(i.e. multiply by itself an get a negative number)

def complex number:
    formal: a + bi | a, b ∈ ℝ    
    in words: a plus b multiplied by i(defined above)

    parts:
        given:
            z = 1 + 2i
        then:
            parts:
                Re(z) = 1 : Real Part
                Im(z) = 2 : Imaginary Part
    
    examples using decimal number system numbers notation: 
        1 + 7i = complex number
        example expression:
            2 + 3i² + 7i
            2 + 3(-1) + 7i
            2 - 3 + 7i
            -1 + 7i
            7i - 1

def complex number set(Censor, 2015):
    formal:
        ℂ = {a + bi | a, b ∈ ℝ}
    plain english: the set of all numbers of the form "a + bi"
                    where 
                        a and b are Real Numbers
                        i is the imaginary unit (√-1)

use cases:
    - solution to equations:
        example using decimal number system numbers notation:
            given:
                equation₁: x^2 + 1 = 0
            when:
                equation₁ has no solution in ℝ
            then:
                in Complex Numbers(i.e. ℂ), a solution exists (Censor, 2015):
                    solve equation:
                        x² + 1 - 1 = 0 - 1  : subtract 1 from both sides
                        then:
                            x² = -1
                                let x = i
                                ∴ i² = -1
                                which is true in ℂ

remark: in ℂ all equations have solutions (Censor, 2015).
            ℂ is an algebraically closed field.
