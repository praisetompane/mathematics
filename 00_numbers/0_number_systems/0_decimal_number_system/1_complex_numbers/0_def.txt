def 𝑖:
    - formal:
        Let 𝑖  = √-1 (Censor, 2015).
                ∴ i² = -1
    - plain english: define a new number "i", 
                        whose value is the square root of -1.

                NB: This number does not exist in the Real numbers.
                    There is no number you can square(i.e. multiply by itself an get a negative number)

def complex number:
    - formal: 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖 | 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ ℝ  
        - in words: 𝑎 plus 𝑏 multiplied by i(defined above)

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???
    
    - properties:
        - parts:
            - given:
                𝑧 = 1 + 2𝑖
            - then:
                - parts:
                    Re(𝑧) = 1 : Real Part
                    Im(𝑧) = 2 : Imaginary Part
    
    - examples:
        - 1 + 7𝑖
        - example expression:
            2 + 3𝑖² + 7𝑖
            2 + 3(-1) + 7𝑖
            2 - 3 + 7𝑖
            -1 + 7𝑖
            7𝑖 - 1

    - use cases:
        - solution to equations:
            example using decimal number system numbers notation:
                given:
                    equation₁: 𝑥² + 1 = 0
                when:
                    equation₁ has no solution in ℝ
                then:
                    in Complex Numbers(i.e. ℂ), a solution exists (Censor, 2015):
                        solve equation:
                            𝑥² + 1 - 1 = 0 - 1   : subtract 1 from both sides
                            then:
                                𝑥² = -1
                                    𝑙𝑒𝑡 𝑥 = 𝑖
                                    ∴ 𝑖² = -1
                                    which is true in ℂ

def complex number set(Censor, 2015):
    - formal: ℂ = {𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖 | 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ ℝ}

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: the set of all numbers of the form "𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖" where,  
                        𝑎 and 𝑏  are Real Numbers and,
                        i is the imaginary unit (√-1)

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - remark: in ℂ all equations have solutions (Censor, 2015).
            ℂ is an algebraically closed field.
