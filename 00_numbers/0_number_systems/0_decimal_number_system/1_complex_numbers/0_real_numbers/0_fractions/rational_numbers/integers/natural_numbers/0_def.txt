def natural numbers¹(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:2):
    - ℕ = {1,2,3,4,...}
    - remarks:
        also known as Counting numbers.

def natural number²(Wildberger, 2009): a string of ones(i.e. one = |)

def natural numbers³(Wildberger, 2009): a collection(i.e. Set) of these strings of ones.
    - properties:
        - they form a sequence(i.e. they are naturally ordered):
            - for every natural number, we can associate/define/determine a "successor":
                example:
                    S(|) = || = successor of | is ||

                short form: ∀a,b ∈ ℕ, ∃b | S(a) = b ∧ b = a + |
                
                remark: this is our first Mathematical operator.

            Q: Why do Natural numbers form a sequence?
                MYINC:
                    1. We start with |
                    2. to get || we require | to exist, because we add | to | to get ||.
                    3. to get ||| we require || to exist, because  we add | to || to get |||
                    They come into existence in an order.

        - relative size of natural numbers:
            - i.e. which number is bigger than another?
                example:
                    given: two numbers
                            ||||
                            ||||||
                    then:
                        pair each one(i.e. |) in one number with a one in the other number.
                    then:
                        the number left with unpaired ones is the larger of the two.
            - abstract notation:
                let:
                    - n and m be natural numbers
                then:
                    - equality:
                        formal:
                            n = m ⟺ |s in n match |s in m

                            in words:
                                n equals m, if and only if, |s in n match |s in m
                        remark: this is our second Mathematical operator.

                    - inequality:
                        formal:
                            n < m ⟺ |s in n are less than |s in m

                            in words:
                                n is less than m , if and only if, |s in n are less than |s in m
                                    remark: this is our third Mathematical operator.
                    
use cases:
    - count apples, goats etc.
    - solution to equations:
        example:
            given:
                equation₁: x + 1 = 5
            then:
                in Natural Numbers(i.e. ℕ), a solution exists (Censor, 2015):
                    solve equation:
                        x + 1 - 1 = 5 - 1 : substract 1 from both sides
                        then:
                            x = 5 - 1
                            x = 4
                        substituion test:
                            let x = 4
                                x + 1 = 5
                                4 + 1 = 5
                                5 = 5
                                which is true
