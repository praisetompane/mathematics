def distributive laws/properties of addition and multiplication(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:54):
    - formal:
        given:
            numbers:
                - n
                - m
                - k
        then:
            - law 1: k × (n + m) = (k × n) + (k × m)
                          = k × n + k × m
                            NB: simplified notational rewrite without the parenthesis. 
                                we interpret this as multiplication takes precedence over addition.
                                i.e. we multiply first before we add.
                            Question: Why does the order of the multiplication and addition matter and gives different answers?
            
            - law 2: (k + n) × m = (k × m) + (n × m) 
                          = k × m + n × m
    - plain english:
        - properties/laws that connect addition(+) and multiplication(×).

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples:
        - law 1: 2 × (3 + 4):
                2 × 3 + 2 × 4
                6 + 2 × 4
                6 + 8
                14
        - law 2: (6 + 3) × 2:
                6 × 2 + 3 × 2
                12  + 3 × 2
                12 + 6
                18
