def division:
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: split m into n equal parts.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: 
        - notation: m/n
        - division by zero is undefined (Weisstein, 2024)
                plain english: split 7 into 0 equal parts
                result: we cannot split a 7 into zero parts.
                        in current mathematics we have no way to do this, hence it is undefined.
                notation: 7/0 is undefined.

    - examples:
        plain english: split 5 into 2 equal parts
        result: 2.5 and 2.5
        notation: 5/2

        plain english: split 2 into 1 equal part
        result: 2
        notation: 2/1 = 2

    - use cases: 
        - share a cake with family/friends
        
    - proof: ???
