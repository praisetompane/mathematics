def absolute value(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7): 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: 
        the distance on the number line, 
            from zero to a number,
            regardless of the sign(i.e. direction) of the number (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7).
            
    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - absolute value is always positive(non negative), as it is DISTANCE from zero (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7).
            Example: 
                |4| = 4 because, 4 is a distance of 4 from zero(0)
                |-4| = 4 because, -4 is a distance of 4 from zero(0)
            Question: Can we not have negative distance?

            |6| = 6, because, 6 is a distance of 6 unit from zero(0)(see below number line)
                              *   *   *   *   *   * = 6 distance units
            <---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-->  
            -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7

        - notation:
            |x|, where x is a single number
                if x an expression/mathematical statement
                    it must be reduced/simplified to a single number first (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7).
                        i.e. the arithmetic/algebra must be performed first before apply the absolute function

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???
        Why do we need this?
            To get the distance from a origin point(location)
                to another point(location)

    - proof: ???
