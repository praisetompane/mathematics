def rational number¹(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3): 
    - formal:
            𝑟 = m/n | m,n ∈ ℤ ∧ n ≠ 0

        - in words: any number 𝑟 that can be written as a fraction/ratio of two integers.

    - use cases:
        - solution to equations:
            - examples:
                - 𝑥 × 5 = 12:
                    let:
                        𝑥 = 12/5
                    then:
                        12/5 × 5 = 12
                        12/5 × 5/1 = 12
                        (12 × 5)/5 = 12
                        60/5 = 12
                        12 = 12
                        ∴ 𝑥 = 12/5 is a solution to the equation.

def rational numbers set (Censor, 2015): 
    - formal: ℚ = { m/n | m,n ∈ ℤ ∧ n ≠ 0 }

        - in words: numbers of the form 𝑚 divided 𝑛, 
                    where 𝑚 and 𝑛 are integers(i.e. ℤ)
                    and 𝑛 cannot be zero(0)

    - plain english: Real numbers that can be written as a fraction and therefore can be plotted on a number line(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).

Q: Is there a formal proof for these?
    - all integers are Rational numbers(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
    - all natural numbers are Rational numbers(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
