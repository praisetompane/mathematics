def rational numbers¹: 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: any number that can be written as a fraction of two integers(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
                i.e. a ratio of two integers (Censor, 2015).

                ℚ = {m/n | m ∈ ℤ ∧ n ∈ ℤ ∧ n ≠ 0}
                * Key is they can be represented as fractions(i.e. as ratios)

def rational numbers²: 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: Real numbers that can be written as a fraction and therefore can be plotted on a number line(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).

Question: Is there a formal proof for these?
    - all integers are Rational numbers(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
    - all natural numbers are Rational numbers(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
