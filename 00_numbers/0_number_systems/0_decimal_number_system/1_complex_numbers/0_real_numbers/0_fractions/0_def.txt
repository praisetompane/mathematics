def fraction(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3): 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: 
            an integer divided by a nonzero integer.
                i.e. a ratio of two integers (Censor, 2015).
                        Question: Does the numerator and denominator have to be integers?
                            e.g. are  π/5, √5/9 not fractions?
                        Question: are they merely a way to represent division?
