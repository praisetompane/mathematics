def fraction: an integer divided by a nonzero integer(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
    i.e. a ratio of two integers (Censor, 2015).
            Question: Does the numerator and denominator have to be integers?
                e.g. are  π/5, √5/9 not fractions?
            Question: are they merely a way to represent division?
