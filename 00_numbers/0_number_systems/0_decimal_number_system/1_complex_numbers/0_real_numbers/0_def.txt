def real numbers¹(Censor, 2015):
  informal:
    ℝ = {x | -∞ < x ∞ }
  plain english:
    the set of all numbers x
      such that x is between negative infinity and positive infinity

def real numbers²: all numbers that can be represented on a number line(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:2).
  ℝ = ℚ ∪ 𝕀

def real numbers³(Censor, 2015):
    real numbers are complex numbers
        of the form (𝑎 + 0𝑖) 
    
    examples:
        2:
            2 = 2 + 0i
            2 = 2  NB: any number multiplied by zero(0) is zero(0)
            ∴ True

      Question: Are there categories for irrational numbers?
