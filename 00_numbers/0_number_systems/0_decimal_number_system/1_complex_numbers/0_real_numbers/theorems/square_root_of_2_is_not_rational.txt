theorem: √2 ∉ ℚ (Censor, 2013)
    Let:
        √2 ∈ ℚ
            with √2 = m/n expressed in reduced form, where m,n ∈ ℤ and n ≠ 0.
            then m and n do not have common factors.
    Then:
        proof steps:
            type: proof by contradiction.

            0. √2 = m/n  
            1. (√2)² = m²/n²                                    : square each side of the equation.
                result: 2 = m²/n²
            2. 2 = m²/n²                                        : multiply each side of the equation with n²/1.   
                result: m² = 2n²

            3. m² = 2n² => m² is even                           : because 2n² is divisible by 2 and therefore even.
                                                                    m² has to be even since it is equal 2n²(which is even).

            4. m² is even => m is even                          : because only an even number can be squared to produce another even number.
            
            5. m is even => m is divisible by 2                 : because m being even means it has a factor 2

            6. m is divisible by 2 => m² is divisible by 4      : because the square of an even number is divisible by four(4)
                                                                    good explanation: https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2008-2009/ABjorndahl/crunch.html

            7. m² is divisible by 4 => 2n² is divisible by 4    : because 2n² equals m²

            8. 2n² is divisible by 4 => n² is divisible by 2    : 
                details:
                    given:
                        2n² is divisible by 4
                    then:
                        - 2n² = 4y                      : 2n² is 4 times some number y.
                        - 2n²/2 = 4y/2                  : divide both sides by 2.
                            result: n² = 2y
                        - n² = 2y => n² is even         : n² is even, because it is 2 times some number y.
                        - n² is even => n² is divisible by 2    : because numbers divisible by 2 are even                     

            9. n² is divisible by 2  => n² is even              : numbers divisible by 2 are even.

            10. n² is even => n is even                         : because only an even number can be squared to produce another even number.

            11. n is even AND m is even is a contradiction of the initial conditions to have m and n in reduced form.

            ∴ √2 ∉ Q: QED
