de addition (Censor, 2015):
    - formal:
      given:
        (𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖) + (𝑐 + 𝑑𝑖)
      then, addition is:
        (𝑎 + 𝑐) + (𝑏𝑖 + 𝑑𝑖)
        (𝑎 + 𝑐) + (𝑏 + 𝑑)𝑖

      - in words: 
        1. add the Real parts together.
        2. add the Imaginary parts together.
        3. add the two results.

    - plain english: apply addition to the like terms(i.e. 𝑎 with 𝑏 and 𝑐𝑖 with 𝑑𝑖) and add the results.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples:
      1. 
        given:
          (1 + 2𝑖) + (3 - 5𝑖)
        then, the sum is:
          (1 + 3) + (2𝑖 - 5𝑖)
          (4 + (-3𝑖))
          (4 - 3𝑖)

    - use cases: ???
