def equality:
    - formal:
      given:
        𝑧 = (𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖)
        𝑤 = (𝑐 + 𝑑𝑖)
      then, equality is:
        𝑧 = 𝑤, if Re(𝑧) = Re(𝑤) AND Im(𝑧) = Re(𝑤)

      - in words: 𝑧 equals 𝑤, if the Real part of 𝑧 equals the Real part of 𝑤, and,
                              the Imaginary part of 𝑧 equals the Imaginary part pf 𝑤.

    - plain english: the like terms of 𝑧 and 𝑤 are equal.
