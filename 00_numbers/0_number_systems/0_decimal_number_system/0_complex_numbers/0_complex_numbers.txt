def 𝑖(Censor, 2015):
    - formal:
        Let 𝑖  = √-1.
                ∴ 𝑖² = -1
    - plain english: 
        - define a new number 𝑖, whose value is the square root of -1.
        or
        - define a new number 𝑖, which when squared it equals -1(i.e. 𝑖² = -1)

        NB: This number does not exist in the Real numbers.
            There is no number you can square(i.e. multiply by itself an get any negative number).

def complex number(Censor, 2015):
    - formal: 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖 | 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ ℝ  
        - in words: 𝑎 plus 𝑏 multiplied by 𝑖(defined above)

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???
    
    - properties:
        - parts:
            - given:
                𝑧 = 1 + 2𝑖
            - then:
                - parts:
                  Re(𝑧) = 1 : Real Part
                  Im(𝑧) = 2 : Imaginary Part
    
    - examples:
        - 1 + 7𝑖
        2 + 3𝑖² + 7𝑖
        2 + 3(-1) + 7𝑖
        2 - 3 + 7𝑖
        -1 + 7𝑖
        7𝑖 - 1

    - use cases:
        - solution to equations:
            - examples:
                1.
                  given:
                      𝑥² + 1 = 0:
                  then:
                      let 𝑥 = 𝑖
                      𝑖² + 1 = 0
                      √-1 × √-1 + 1 = 0
                      -1¹/² * -1^½ + 1 = 0
                      -1¹/²⁺¹/² + 1 = 0
                      -1²/² + 1  = 0
                      -1¹/¹ + 1 = 0
                      -1¹ + 1 = 0
                      -1 + 1 - 0
                      0 = 0
                      ∴ 𝑥 = 𝑖 is a solution to the equation.

def complex number set(Censor, 2015):
    - formal: ℂ = { 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖 | 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ ℝ }

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: the set of all numbers of the form "𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖" where,  
                        𝑎 and 𝑏  are Real Numbers and,
                        𝑖 is the imaginary unit (√-1)

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - ℂ is an algebraically closed Field. In ℂ, any single variable equation has a solution (Censor, 2015).

        - def algebraically closed: the fundamental theorem of algebra is satisfied:
