        - in words: ???

    - plain english: a numbers that can be represented on a number line(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:2).

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - use cases:
      - solutions to equations:
        - examples:
          - 𝑥² = 3:
            let:
              𝑥 = √3
            then:
              (√3)² = 3
              3 = 3
              ∴ 𝑥 = √3 is a solution

    - formal: ℝ = {𝑥 | -∞ < 𝑥 ∞ }
          NB: This is an imprecise definition.

        - in words: all numbers between negative infinity and positive infinity.
                    NB: not inclusive of negative and positive infinity.

def real numbers set²(Censor, 2015):
    - formal: ℝ = { 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑖 | 𝑏 = 0 ∧ 𝑎,𝑏 ∈ (-∞, ∞) }
    
        NB: This is an imprecise definition.

      - in words: real numbers are complex numbers of the form (𝑎 + 0𝑖).
    
    - examples:
        2:
            2 = 2 + 0𝑖
            2 = 2  NB: any number multiplied by zero(0) is zero(0)
            ∴ True
