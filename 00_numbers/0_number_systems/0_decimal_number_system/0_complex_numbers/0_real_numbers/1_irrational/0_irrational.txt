def irrational numbers set(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3): 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: Real numbers that cannot be represented as fractions(ratios).
                      They are infinite and non-repeating decimals (Khan Academy).
                      e.g. √2, √5 π, φ, ⅇ, etc

                  𝕀 = {x | x ∈ ℝ ∧ x ∉ ℚ}
                  𝕀 = ℝ \ ℚ = Real numbers - Rational numbers
