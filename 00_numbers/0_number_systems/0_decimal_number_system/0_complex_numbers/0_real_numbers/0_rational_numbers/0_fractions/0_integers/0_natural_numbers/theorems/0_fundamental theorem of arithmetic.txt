def fundamental theorem of arithmetic:
    - formal: ∀𝑛 ∈ ℕ, 𝑛 ≥ 2
                ∃{𝑎₁, 𝑎₂, 𝑎₃, ..., 𝑎ₙ} where 𝑎₁, 𝑎₂, 𝑎₃, ..., 𝑎ₙ are prime numbers
                such that 𝑎₁ × 𝑎₂ × 𝑎₃ × ... × 𝑎ₙ = 𝑛

        - in words: for any natural number 𝑛 greater or equal to 2, there exists a unique(i.e. exactly one) prime factorization.
                    remark: the order of the factors does not matter.

        Q: What are the prime factors of the prime numbers?
            Considering 1 is not a prime number.

    - plain english: for any natural number 𝑛 greater or equal to 2, there is a unique combination of prime numbers that can be multiplied to get 𝑛.
