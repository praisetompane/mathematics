def multiplication¹(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:19):
    - formal:
        - in words:
            - repeated addition(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:19)
                of multiple equal groups of something(Khan Academy)
        
            - Generalization Multiplication Algorithm(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:21):
                Multiplication signs = { x, *, · , ()() }
                1. Multiply the numbers, ignoring the signs
                    1.1. If the signs are the same, result = Positive
                    1.2. If signs are different, result = Negative

                2. Alternatively, In the repeated addition addition form
                    Count number of negative numbers
                        If even, then result = Positive
                        If odd, then result = Negative

        - examples:  
            3 groups of five
            3 fives 
            5 + 5 + 5 = 15 or 5 x 3 = 15
            5 is repeatedly added 3 times

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - factors: numbers being multiplied in a multiplication sentence (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:19).
            - example:    
                5 x 3 = 15
                5 and 3 are factors of 15
        - structure: 
            factor x factor = product
        
        - models(ways to think about multiplication):
            5 x (-4):
                -4 + (-4) + (-4) + (-4) + (-4) = -20

                N N | N N | N N | N N | N N |  => N N N N N N N N N N
                N N | N N | N N | N N | N N |     N N N N N N N N N N

                Generalization(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:21):
                    N x P = N       OR      P x N = N

                4 x (-1):
                    -1 + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -4 [Follow rules of addition]
                
                -2 x 5:
                    -1*5 x 5
                    -1 x (5 + 5)
                    -1 x (10)
                    ∴ -10

                    Question: Why does multiplication by -1 result in a negative?

            -1 x 3:
                same as 3x(-1):
                    -1 + (-1) + (-1) = -3

                Generalization:
                    -1x(any_number) = opposite of any_number
                    -1x4 = -4
                        because -4 is the opposite of 4

            -3 x (-4):
                Sol 1:
                    same -1*3 x (-4) (i.e. opposite of 3 times 4)
                        3 x (-4): temporarily remove opposite
                        -4 + (-4) + (-4)
                        -12
                    apply opposite removed from -3
                        -1 x (-12)
                    ∴ 12, opposite of -12 is 12
                
                Sol 2:
                    opposite of 3 x opposite of 4
                    -1x3 x -1x4
                    3 x 4[multiply the "main/subject" numbers. Keep record "opposition" number]
                        3 x 4
                        4 + 4 + 4 = 12
                    apply first "opposition" number
                        opposite of 12 = -12
                            -1 x 12 = -12
                    apply second "opposition" number
                        opposite of -12 = 12
                            -1 x (-12)
                    ∴ 12

                Generalization(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:21):
                    N x N = P       OR      P x P = P

                    N x N = P:  
                        N1 x N2 => The opposite of the opposite of N = N        
                            -1*N x -1*N
                            -1*(-1) x N*N
                                -1*(-1) = opposite of opposite
                                N*N = repeated addition
                                ∴ opposite of opposite of repeated addition
                    P x P = P:
                        P1 x P2 => just repeated addition of P2, P1 times
