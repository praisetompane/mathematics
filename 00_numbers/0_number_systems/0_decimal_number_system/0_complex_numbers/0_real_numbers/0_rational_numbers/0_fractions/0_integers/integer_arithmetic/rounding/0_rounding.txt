def rounding: 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english:
        finding the closest value 
            for the place value we are rounding(Khan Academy).
            place value = { ..., ones, tens, hundreds, tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ... }

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        General Nearest Rounding Algorithm (Khan Academy):
            Given:
                - number
                - place_value_to_round ={..., hundreds, tens, ones, tenths, hundredths, ...}
            
            Then:                                                               
                if number in the preceding place value from place_value_to_round >= 5
                    return next multiple of place_value_to_round for number
                else
                    return the previous multiple of place_value_to_round for number

    - examples: ???
        place_value_to_round = tens
        value = 674
        multiple of 10 greater than 674 = 680
        multiple of 10 less than 674 = 670
        rounded_value = 670
            you are closer to 670 than 680
            i.e. closer on the number line
                you are 4 place values(i.e. ones) to 670
                you are 6 place values(i.e. ones) to 680

        <----|----|------|--->  
            670  674    680 

    - use cases:
        - write down irrational numbers, for which there exists NO complete numerical form.
        - make numbers easier to manipulate, when the extra precision is not needed.

    - proof: ???
