def substation¹:
    the opposite of addition
        the act of removing quantity from a place value(i.e. ...,the hundreds ,the tens, the ones, the tenths, the hundredths,...)
            during this act: 
                if the quantity to remove exceeds the quantity in the current place value
                    we convert 1(one) quantity of the next higher place, into the current place value
                        the conversion = the 1(one) quantity * base of the number system(often 10) + 
                                        quantity in current place value
