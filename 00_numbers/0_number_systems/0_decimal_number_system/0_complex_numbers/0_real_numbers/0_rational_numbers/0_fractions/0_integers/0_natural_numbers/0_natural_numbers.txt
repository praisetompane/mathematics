def natural number(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008):
    - formal: 𝑛/𝑚 : 𝑛, 𝑚 ≥ 0 ∧ 𝑛 = 𝑚 ???

        - in words: the quotient of dividing any number by itself.

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples:
        - 0
        - 1
        - 67
        - ...

    - use cases:
        - count apples, goats etc.
        - solution to equations:
            - example:
                - given:
                    equation₁: 𝑥 + 1 = 5
                - then:
                    𝑥 + 1 - 1 = 5 - 1
                    𝑥 + 0 = 5 - 1
                    𝑥 = 4
                - substitution test:
                    let:
                        𝑥 = 4
                    then:
                        𝑥 + 1 = 5
                        4 + 1 = 5
                        5 = 5, which is true

                - 5 is a Natural number, therefore the Natural number 5 can be used to solve this equation.

    - proof: none. it is a definition.

def natural numbers set¹(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:2):
    - formal:
        ℕ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
        ℕ = {𝑛/𝑚 : 𝑛, 𝑚 ≥ 0 ∧ 𝑛 = 𝑚}, where 𝑛/𝑚 is in reduced/simplified form.

        - in words: the set of ALL non-negative numbers from 0,
                    with each next number, equal to the previous plus 1.

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - remark: sometimes they are defined with 0.
        - axiomatized using Peano axioms.

    - examples:
        - 1
        - 7
        - 1.1/1.1 = 1
        - 5.5/5.5 = 1
        - 100
        - ...

    - proof: none. it is a definition.

def natural number(Wildberger, 2009):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english: a string of ones(i.e. one = |)

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - use cases:
        see: above.

    - examples:
        - || = two
        - ||||| = five
        - ||| = three

    - proof: none. it is a definition.

def natural numbers set¹(Wildberger, 2009):
    - formal: {𝑥 : 𝑥 = ⟨|,|,|,...⟩}

        - in words: the set of all numbers 𝑥,
                        such that 𝑥 is a string of ones.

    - plain english: ???

    - properties:
        - they form a sequence(i.e. they are naturally ordered):
            - plain english: for every natural number, we can associate/define/determine a "successor":
                - example:
                    S(|) = || = successor of | is ||

            - abstract notation: S(a) = a + |
                S = successor

            - remark: this is our first Mathematical operator/operation.

            - Question: Why do Natural numbers form a sequence?
                MYINC:
                    1. We start with |
                    2. to get || we require | to exist, because we add | to | to get ||.
                    3. to get ||| we require || to exist, because  we add | to || to get |||
                    They come into existence in an order.

        - they have relative size to each other:
            - plain english: which number appears first in the sequence.
                - example:
                    - given: two numbers
                            ||||
                            ||||||
                    - then:
                        - pair each one(i.e. |) in one number with a one in the other number.
                    - then:
                        - the number left with unpaired ones is the larger of the two.

                    - therefore:
                        - |||| comes before |||||| in the sequence of Natural numbers.
                        - |||||| is greater than ||||, because it has || left after pairing all the |s from |||| with itself.

            - abstract notation:
                let:
                    - 𝑛 and 𝑚 be natural numbers
                then:
                    - equality:
                        - formal: 𝑛 = 𝑚 ⟺ |s in 𝑛 match |s in 𝑚.

                            - in words:
                                𝑛 equals 𝑚, if and only if, |s in 𝑛 match |s in 𝑚.

                        - remark: this is our second Mathematical operator.

                    - inequality:
                        - formal: 𝑛 < m ⟺ |s in n are less than |s in 𝑚.

                            - in words:
                                𝑛 is less than 𝑚 , if and only if, |s in 𝑛 are less than |s in 𝑚.

                        - remark: this is our third Mathematical operator.
