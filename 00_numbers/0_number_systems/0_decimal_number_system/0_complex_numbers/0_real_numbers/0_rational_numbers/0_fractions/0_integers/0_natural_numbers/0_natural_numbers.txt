    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - count apples, goats etc.
        - solution to equations:
            - example:
                - given:
                    equation₁: x + 1 = 5
                - then:
                    x + 1 - 1 = 5 - 1
                    x + 0 = 5 - 1
                    x = 4
                - substitution test:
                    let:
                        x = 4
                    then:
                        x + 1 = 5
                        4 + 1 = 5
                        5 = 5, which is true

                - 5 is a Natural number, therefore the Natural number 5 can be used to solve this equation.

        ℕ = {0,1,2,3,4,...}
        ℕ = {n/m | n,m ≥ 0 ∧ n = m}, where n/m is in reduced/simplified form.

        - in words:
            the set of ALL non-negative numbers from 0, with each next number, equal to the previous plus 1.

    - properties:
        - remark: sometimes they are defined without 0.
        - axiomatized using Peano axioms.

        - 7
        - 1.1/1.1 = 1

def natural numbers set¹(Wildberger, 2009):
    - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

    - plain english: a collection(i.e. Set) of these strings of ones.

    - properties:
        - they form a sequence(i.e. they are naturally ordered):
            - plain english: for every natural number, we can associate/define/determine a "successor":
                - example:
                    S(|) = || = successor of | is ||

            - abstract notation: S(a) = a + |
                S = successor

            - remark: this is our first Mathematical operator/operation.

            - Question: Why do Natural numbers form a sequence?
                MYINC:
                    1. We start with |
                    2. to get || we require | to exist, because we add | to | to get ||.
                    3. to get ||| we require || to exist, because  we add | to || to get |||
                    They come into existence in an order.

        - they have relative size to each other:
            - plain english: which number appears first in the sequence.
                - example:
                    - given: two numbers
                            ||||
                            ||||||
                    - then:
                        - pair each one(i.e. |) in one number with a one in the other number.
                    - then:
                        - the number left with unpaired ones is the larger of the two.

                    - therefore:
                        - |||| comes before |||||| in the sequence of Natural numbers.
                        - |||||| is greater than ||||, because it has || left after pairing all the |s from |||| with itself.

            - abstract notation:
                - let:
                    - 𝑛 and 𝑚 be natural numbers
                - then:
                    - equality:
                        - formal: 𝑛 = 𝑚 ⟺ |s in 𝑛 match |s in 𝑚.

                            - in words:
                                𝑛 equals 𝑚, if and only if, |s in 𝑛 match |s in 𝑚.

                        - remark: this is our second Mathematical operator.

                    - inequality:
                        - formal: 𝑛 < m ⟺ |s in n are less than |s in 𝑚.

                            - in words:
                                𝑛 is less than 𝑚 , if and only if, |s in 𝑛 are less than |s in 𝑚.

                        - remark: this is our third Mathematical operator.
