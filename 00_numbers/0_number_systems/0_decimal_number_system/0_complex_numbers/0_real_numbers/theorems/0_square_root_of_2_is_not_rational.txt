    - proof: 
        - proof₁(Censor, 2013):
            - let:
                √2 ∈ ℚ
                    with √2 = m/n expressed in reduced form, where 𝑚,𝑛 ∈ ℤ and 𝑛 ≠ 0.
                    then 𝑚 and 𝑛 do not have common factors.
            - then:
                proof type: proof by contradiction.
                proof steps:
                    0. √2 = m/n  
                    1. (√2)² = m²/n²                                    : square each side of the equation.
                        result: 2 = m²/n²
                    2. 2 = m²/n²                                        : multiply each side of the equation with n²/1.   
                        result: m² = 2n²

                    3. m² = 2n² => m² is even                           : because 2n² is divisible by 2 and therefore even.
                                                                            m² has to be even since it is equal 2n²(which is even).

                    4. m² is even => m is even                          : because only an even number can be squared to produce another even number.
                    
                    5. m is even => m is divisible by 2                 : because m being even means it has a factor 2

                    6. m is divisible by 2 => m² is divisible by 4      : because the square of an even number is divisible by four(4)
                                                                            good explanation: https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2008-2009/ABjorndahl/crunch.html

                    7. m² is divisible by 4 => 2n² is divisible by 4    : because 2n² equals m²

                    8. 2n² is divisible by 4 => n² is divisible by 2    : 
                        details:
                            given:
                                2n² is divisible by 4
                            then:
                                - 2n² = 4y                      : 2n² is 4 times some number y.
                                - 2n²/2 = 4y/2                  : divide both sides by 2.
                                    result: n² = 2y
                                - n² = 2y => n² is even         : n² is even, because it is 2 times some number y.
                                - n² is even => n² is divisible by 2    : because numbers divisible by 2 are even                     

                    9. n² is divisible by 2  => n² is even              : numbers divisible by 2 are even.

                    10. n² is even => n is even                         : because only an even number can be squared to produce another even number.

                    11. n is even AND m is even is a contradiction of the initial conditions to have m and n in reduced form.

                    ∴ √2 ∉ Question: QED
