def absolute value(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7): 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: 
        the distance on the number line, 
            from zero to a number,
            regardless of the sign(i.e. direction) of the number (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7).
            
    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - absolute value is always positive(non negative), as it is DISTANCE from zero (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7).
            Example: 
                |4| = 4 because, 4 is a distance of 4 from zero(0)
                |-4| = 4 because, -4 is a distance of 4 from zero(0)
            Question: Can we not have negative distance?

            |6| = 6, because, 6 is a distance of 6 unit from zero(0)(see below number line)
                              *   *   *   *   *   * = 6 distance units
            <---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-->  
            -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7

        - notation:
            |x|, where x is a single number
                if x an expression/mathematical statement
                    it must be reduced/simplified to a single number first (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7).
                        i.e. the arithmetic/algebra must be performed first before apply the absolute function

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???
        Why do we need this?
            To get the distance from a origin point(location)
                to another point(location)

    - proof: ???

def absolute value(Censor, 2013):
    - formal: 
        ∀𝑥 ∈ ℝ, |𝑥| = { 
                        𝑥, 𝑥 ≥ 0
                                    = maximum{𝑥 , -𝑥}
                        -𝑥, 𝑥 < 0
                      }

        - in words:
            - the absolute value of 𝑥 is:
                - 𝑥, when 𝑥 is greater or equal to zero(0).
                - -𝑥, when 𝑥 is less than zero(0)
                    i.e. -1 × -𝑥, when 𝑥 is less than zero(0)
                        𝑥 is negative in the expansion, because it is less 0.
                    i.e. negative of -𝑥

            - the absolute value of 𝑥 is,
                the maximum value of the set of values 𝑥 and -𝑥.

            remark: these two definitions are equivalent.

    - examples:
        - |-5|:
            - applying first definition:
                -1 * -5 = 5
                ∴ |-5| = 5

                NB: This is applying the second case in the first definition(i.e. 𝑥 < 0).

            - applying second definition:
                maximum {-5, -1 × (-5)}
                maximum {-5, 5}
                ∴ |-5| = 5, because:
                                - 5 is the maximum of 5 and -5
                                    i.e. 5 is the greater|highest value between 5 and -5

        - |10|:
            - applying first definition:
                |10| = 10
                
                NB: This is applying the first case in the first definition(i.e. 𝑥 > 0).
        
            - applying second definition:
                maximum {10, -1 × 10}
                maximum {10, -10}
                ∴ |10| = 10, because:
                                - 10 is the maximum of 10 and -10
                                    i.e. 10 is the greater|highest value between 10 and -10

    - use cases: ???
        
    - proof: none. it is a definition.
            NB: see proofs for its properties/theorems.
