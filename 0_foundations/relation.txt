def relation:   
        formal: the totality
                    of ordered pairs
                        whose members
                            are related by some condition (Epp, 2010:14).

                a mathematical structure R is a relation
                    between sets A(domain) and B(codomain), if the properties below are satisfied (Epp, 2010:14):
                
                    1. there exists x in A and
                        y in B such that
                            (x,y) in R

                    2. R is a subset of A x B (i.e. Cartesian product of set A and B)

                def binary relation³ʳᵈ_ᵍʳᵃᵈᵉʳ: it is a subgroup 
                            of a bigger group
                            connected
                                based on a condition.
                            The bigger group has to made that is made of two or more groups

                    NB: This is specifically a binary relation (Epp, 2010:442)
