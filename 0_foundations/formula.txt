def formula: 
    def¹ (Kunen, 2007:4): 
        formal:
            in words : a statement that makes an assertion about a free variable
                            in a given universe;
                            it (the statement) MAY be True for some values of the variable,
                            or MAY be False for some values of the variable.
        plain english:

    def² (Weisstein):

def free variable (Weisstein):
    formal:
        in words: a variable
                    that appears in a Logic formula
                    that exists outside the scope of the quantifier.

def bound variable (Weisstein):
    formal:
        in words: a variable
                    that appears in a Logic formula
                    that is not free.
                  also known as a dummy variable.
