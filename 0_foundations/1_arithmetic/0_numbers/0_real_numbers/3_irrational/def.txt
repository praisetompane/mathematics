def irrational numbers: Real numbers that are not Rational.
                        They cannot be represented as fractions(ratios)(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
                        They are infinite and non-repeating decimals (Khan Academy).
                        e.g. √2, √5 π, φ, ⅇ, etc

                𝕀 = {x | x ∈ ℝ ∧ x ∉ ℚ}
                𝕀 = ℝ \ ℚ = Real numbers - Rational numbers
