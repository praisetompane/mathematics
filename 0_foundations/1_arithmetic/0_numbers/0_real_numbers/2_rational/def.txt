def rational numbers: any number that can be written as fraction of two integers
                is a Rational number(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
                i.e. a ratio of two integers (Censor, 2015).

                ℚ = {m/n | m ∈ ℤ ∧ n ∈ ℤ ∧ n ≠ 0}
                * Key is they can be represented as fractions(i.e. as ratios)

            all integers are Rational numbers: Q: Is there of proof of this?

def fraction: an integer divided by a nonzero integer.
            Q: Does the numerator and denominator have to be integers?
                e.g. are  pi/5, √5/9 not fractions?
            Q: are they merely a way to represent division?
