def function:
    formal: a relation F, is a function 
                from a set A(domain) to a set B(codomain), if it satisfies the properties below(Epp, 2010:17):

                    1.  for all elements x in A,
                            there is an element y in B
                                such that (x,y) in F
                        i.e. ∀x ∈ A, ∃y ∈ B s.t. (x,y) ∈ F

                    2.  for all elements x in A,
                        for all elements y and z in B
                            if (x,y) in F and (x,z) in F, then
                                y = z
                        
                        i.e. ∀x ∈ A, ∀y,z ∈ B
                                (x,y) ∈ F and (x,z) ∈ F, then
                                    y = z

                        i.e. a member in A can map to ONLY
                                one in member B.
                                if it maps to two, they are the same.

    plain english: a mapping
                    between two groups of things, named A and B
                    where
                        each thing in group A
                            can only map to ONE thing in group B.
