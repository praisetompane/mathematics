def absolute value: the distance on the number line 
                        from zero to a number
                        regardless of the sign(i.e. direction) of the number (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7).
    
    absolute value is always positive(nonnegative), as it is DISTANCE from zero (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7).
        Example: 
            |4| = 4 because, 4 is a distance of 4 from zero(0)
            |-4| = 4 because, -4 is a distance of 4 from zero(0)
        Q: Can we not have negative distance?

        |6| = 6, because, 6 is a distance of 6 unit from zero(0)(see below number line)
                          *   *   *   *   *   * = 6 distance units
        <---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-->  
           -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7

    Why do we need this?
        To get the distance from a origin point(location)
            to another point(location)

    Notation:
        |x|, where x is a signle number
             if x an expression/mathematical statement
                it must be reduced/simplified to a single number first (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7).
                    i.e. the arithmetic/algebra must be performed first before apply the absolute function
