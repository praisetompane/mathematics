                    e.g. are  pi/5, ‚àö5/9 not fractions?

                    any number that can be written as fraction of two integers
                      is a Rational number(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
                      i.e. a ratio of two integers (Censor, 2015).

      ùïÄ = {x | x ‚àà ‚Ñù ‚àß x ‚àâ ‚Ñö}
      ùïÄ = ‚Ñù \ ‚Ñö = Real numbers - Rational numbers
        Real numbers that are not Rational, meaning they cannot be represented as fractions(ratios)(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
          i.e.  decimals that do not end.
                decimals that repeat forever.

  Number system:
    our number system is based on 10 (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
      i.e.
        10 ones                 = 1 ten
        10 tens                 = 1 one-hundred
        10 one-hundred          = 1 one-thousand
        10 one-thousand         = 1 ten-thousand
        10 ten-thousand         = 1 one-hundred-thousand
        10 one-hundred-thousand = 1 one-million

      decimals: these are also based on 10(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).

        The number line is split into 10 equal spaces/pieces between 2 digits(i.e. tenths)(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
          e.g. 0 to 1 = 
                0   s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s 1 
                      0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 
                    10 's' between 0 and 1
                    
                0 to 0.1
                s is split into 10 equal spaces as well(i.e hundredths)
                0   s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s 0.1 
                    0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 

        system = ... ,tens, ones . tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths, hundred-thousandths, millionths, ...

          e.g. 13.453 = thirteen and four hundred fifty-three thousandths
                  .453 is read like non decimal number + the ending place at the end
                        i.e. four hundred fifty-three  + thousandths
                  "and" represents the decimal
                1.0034 = one and thirty-four ten thousandths
      * Q: Can we infinitely divide the space between 2 digits? [within a chosen base]
        Yes, that how we get infinite decimals (i.e the irrational numbers.)

  Comparison:

    when comparing Real Numbers, the number most left on the number line is the lesser of the two (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:5).
      Examples:
        -5 < -4 = True
          How?
            Given:
              -5 of "some things"
              Acquire 1 of those "some things"
                Then
                  You have -4 of "some things".
                  Getting 1 more of "some things" get yous to -4 of "some things"
                  ‚à¥ -4 > -5
            Because -4 is further to the Right on the number line than -5
                    -5 is further to the Left on the number line than -4

        4.23 < 4.2 = False
          How?
            4.23 is further to the Right on the number line(by 0.03 units)
              headed closer 4.3, which is greater that 4.2

        -10 >= -11 = True
          Because -10 is further to the Right on the number line
                  -11 is further to the Left on the number line

        7.01 < 7.1 = True 
          Because 7.1 is further to the Right on the number line
                  7.01 is further to the Left on the number line

        Given:
          you owe $4
          your friend owes $3
        Then:
          you have a larger debt than your friend.
          ‚à¥ you have "less" money [Assuming you have the same total money]

      Something Interesting: 
        Equality in the Set of Negative numbers(‚Ñù‚Åª) is opposite to Equality in the Set of Positive numbers(‚Ñù‚Å∫).
        Q: can we prove this for all Real Numbers?
        Q: Does this apply to Complex Numbers?
        
          Examples:
            Positives                 Negatives 
              4 < 5 = True              -4 < -5 = False
              6 > 7 = False             -6 > -7 = True
              10 >= 100 = False         -10 >= -100 = True
              
      Something Interesting:
        Given two Negative numbers
          The number with a greater absolute value is less than the other

        Examples:
          -4 and -5
            |-4| = 4, |-5| = 5

            5 > 4
            ‚à¥ -5 < -4
          
          -71.24 and -71.2
            |-71.24| = 71.24, |-71.2| = 71.2

            71.24 > 71.2
            ‚à¥ -71.24 < 71.2

      Something Interesting:  
        with < and  >, the mouth of sign always eats the big number (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:5).

      Something Interesting:
        The "value" of a number is determined by its position on the number line.
          Then its position on the number line determines whether it is <,=,> than other numbers

Exercises 1.1 (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:5).

Which set/sets of numbers do the numbers belong?
  1. -13      :      Integers, Rational  
  2. 50       :      Positive, Whole, Integers, Rational
  3. 1/2      :      Rational
  4. -3.5     :      Rational
  5. ‚àö15      :      Irrational
  6. 5.333    :      Rational

  NB: decimals and fractions are Rational
     they are real numbers that are representable as Fractions

     1/2 = already Fraction
                                           GCD = 5
     -3.5 =  (-3/5 * 10)/10 = -35/10 = (-35/5)/(10/5) = -7/2

True or False?

  13. -4 <= -4:       True, Because they are on the same place on the number line

  14. -5 > -2:        False, Because -5 is further to the Left on the number line
                                     -2 is further to the Right on the number line

  15. -20 < -12:      True, Because -20 is further to the Left on the number line
                                     -12 is further to the Right on the number line

  16. 30.5 > 30.05:   True, Because 30.5 is further to the Right on the number line
                                    30.05 is further to the Left on the number line

  17. -4 < -4:        False, Because they are on the same place on the number line, they are Equal

  18. -71.24 > -71.2: False, Because -71.2 is further to the Right on the number line
                                     -71.24 is further to Left on the number line
