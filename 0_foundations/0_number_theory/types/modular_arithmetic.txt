    modular arithmetic: branch of mathematics that deals with
                            integer arithmetic on a circular number line that
                                has fixed set of numbers.
    modulus relationship equation:
        a = b(mod n)
        means => a is congruent b in modulus n context
                 a is equivalent to b in a modulus n context,
                    as they have the same remainder when divided by n(the modulus)

        Example:
            17 = 5(mod 12)
            17 is congruent 5 in modulus 12 context

            17 / 12 = 1 R 5
            5 / 12  = 0 R 5
Constraint:
    All arithmetic operations performed on this number line
        will wrap around when they reach the maximum number
            called the modulus

Example:
    12 hour clock:
        modulus = 12

    Addition:
        Given 08:00am
        Add 9 hours
        Ans = 8 o'clock + 9 = 17 o'clock
        In modulus 12 context:
            17%12 = 5 o'clock
            Therefore: 5PM
            Therefore: 17 and 5 are equivalent in modulus 12(short mod 12) context
