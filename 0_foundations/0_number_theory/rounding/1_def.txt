finding the closest value 
    for the place value we are rounding(Khan Academy).
    place value = { ..., ones, tens, hundreds, tenths, hudrenths, thousandths, ... }
     
question answered: which multiple of the place value you are rounding
                        are you closest to?

example:
    place_value_to_round = tens
    value = 674
    multiple of 10 greater than 674 = 680
    multiple of 10 less than 674 = 670
    rounded_value = 670
        you are closer to 670 than 680
        i.e. closer on the number line
             you are 4 place values(i.e. ones) to 670
             you are 6 place values(i.e. ones) to 680

General Nearest Rounding Algorithm (Khan Academy).
    Given:
        number
        place_value_to_round ={..., hundreds, tens, ones, tenths, hundredths, ...}
    
    Then                                                               
        if number in preceeding place value from place_value_to_round >= 5
            return next multiple of place_value_to_round for number
        else
            return previous multiple of place_value_to_round for number
