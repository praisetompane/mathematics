Models to understand the MEANING of addition:
    Positive numbers:
        Counting(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:7):
            To add 13 + 14
                Take two sets of  objects
                    one contains 13 objects
                    one contains 14 objects
                Gather the two sets, into one set
                    count the objects in the new set = 27
                ∴ 13 + 14 = 27 => mathematical sentence to represent above
                
        Climbing steps(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:9)

        Walking to the left and/or right on the numberline from zero(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008)
            negative = walk left
            positive = walk right
            x + y
            Flow
                walk x positions
                from the x pisition
                    walk y positions
                        the answer is the next pisition you end up on.
            Example
                5 + (-4)
                                -   -   -   -
                                *   *   *   *   * => walk 5 units to the right
                <---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-->  
                -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                ∴ answer = 1


                5 + 3
                                                    +   +   + walk 3 units to the right
                                +   +   +   +   +   => walk 5 units to the right
                <---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|>  
                -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
                ∴ answer = 8

        Examples:
            8 + 7 = 15
            6 + 8 = 14

        Large(multiple place value) number addition:
            place values:  
            million, hundred thousand, ten thousand,  thousand, hundred, ten, one : tenth, hundredth, thousandth, ten thousandth, hundred thousandth,
            Q:
                Why does it look like place values are read in groups of 3?
                    i.e. 436,543, 120 => Four hundred and thirty six million, five hundred forty three thousand, one hundred twenty
                    
    Negative numbers:
            Negative and Positive numbers negate each other to zero(0)
                More specifically the positve and negative ones(1s) negate each other(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:9)

    
Genearal Integer Addition algorithm(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:10):
        If addends(numbers) have same sign:
            add their absolute values
            attach the common sign
        if addends(numbers) have different sign:
            substract their absolute values(subtract the smaller smaller from larger)
            attach the sign of the larget absolute value

Q: Why numbers after the decimal point, start with tenth and not oneth?

Q: Do we know why we can count?
Q: Do all "addable" mathematical objects have their number line equivalent?
