Adding negative-positive pairs(which are equiavlent to zero) to have enough value to cancel out the subtrahend¹ 

    Legend:
        P = Positive Number
        N = Negative Number
        NP = Negative-Positive pair = 0

    4 - 7: 
        P P    =>   P P     NP NP   => N    N
        P P         P P     NP         N    

        ∴ -3
        Subtrahend = 7
            Add 3 negative-positive pairs to have enough P to cancel out 7 P.

        Same Example using 1 and -1
            4 - 7:
                1 1 => 1 1  -1 & 1 -1 & 1 => -1 -1
                1 1    1 1  -1 & 1           -1

                ∴ -3

    -4 - 5:
        N N => N N NP NP NP => N N N N N
        N N    N N NP NP       N N N N
        
        ∴ -9
            Subtrahend = 5
            Add 5 negative-positive pairs to have enough P to cancel out 5 P.

    -3 - 7:
        N N => N N NP NP NP NP => N N N N N N
        N      N   NP NP NP       N   N N N

        ∴ -10
            Subtrahend = 7
            Add 7 negative-positive pairs to have enough P to cancel out 7 P.

    -4 - (-6):
        N N => N N NP => P =>
        N N    N N NP    P

        Subtrahend = -6
            Add 2 negative-positive pairs to have enough N to cancel out 6 N.

    3 - (-2):
        P P => P P NP => P P P 
        P      P   NP    P   P

        Subtrahend = -2
            Add 2 negative-positive pairs to have enough N to cancel out 2 N.

        ∴ 5

    −3 − 7
        N N => N N NP NP NP NP => N N N N N N
        N      N   NP NP NP       N N N N

        Subtrahend = 7
            Add 7 negative-positive pairs to have enough P to cancel out 7

        ∴ -10   

    -4 - (-6)
        N N => N N NP =>  P
        N N    N N NP     P

        Subtrahend = -6
            Add 2 negative-positive pairs to have enough N to cancel out 6
        
        ∴ 2

    -4 + 6
        N N => N N P P P => P 
        N N    N N P P P    P

        Subtrahend is actually 4, as it is the negative value, even though it is the first term
            Add the 6 P
            4 P cancel out 4 N
        
        ∴ 2

    -4 - (-6) and -4 + 6 result in the same answer
    
    Observations:
        Substracting a negative number(ex. -6) equivalent to adding the opposite number(ex. 6)² 
            -4 - (-6) = -4 + 6 = 2

    If there is negative term(even if adding), you are going to subtract (i.e. -A + B)
    If there substration operator is explicitly used in the sentence(i.e. A - B)

General Integer Substraction algorithm³ 
    1. Identify that is a subtraction
    2. Identify the numbers being substracted (minuend[RHS] and subtrahend[LHS])
    3. 
        - Leave the minuend unchanged
        - ADD the opposite of the subtrahend
    4. Follow the rules of addition

    Examples:
        -21 - 13
            Substraction? = T
            -21 + (-13): ADD the opposite of the subtrahend
            |21| + |13| = |34| = -8: Apply Addition rules

        -11 - 22
            Substraction? = T
            -11 + (-22): ADD the opposite of the subtrahend
            |11| + |22| = |33| = -33: Apply Addition rules

        -1603 - (-128)
            Substraction? = T
            -1603 + 128: ADD the opposite of the subtrahend
            |1603| - |128| = |1475| = -1475: Apply Addition rules

        -201 - (-454)
            Substraction? = T
            -201 + 454: ADD the opposite of the subtrahend
            |201| + |454| = |253| = 253: Apply Addition rules

        331 - (-729)
            Substraction? = T
            311 + 729 Add the opposite of the subtrahend
            |311| + |729| = |1060| = 1040

        188 - 560
            Substraction? = T
            188 + (-560): ADD the opposite of the subtrahend
            |188| - |560| = |372| = -372: Apply Addition rules
