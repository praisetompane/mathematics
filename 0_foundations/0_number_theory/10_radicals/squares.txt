def: raising a number to the power of 2 ⁽ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᴼⁿ_ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ⁾ Q: Is there a better def?
    4 squared is 16: Q: What does it mean to square a number?

    squareroot(16) is 4: the root(i.e. base) of the squared representation of the number.

    given:
        square(actual shape)
            with side length 4

        area of the square = 4² (4 squared) = l * b, l = b for square = 4 * 4 = 16
            NB: The number of squares of length 1 in
                this area(space) = 16 as well

Example:
    4² = 16
    squareroot(16) = 4
