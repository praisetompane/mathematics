def multiplication: repeated addition(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:19)
    of multiple equal groups of something(Khan Academy)

    Example:  
        3 groups of five
        3 fives 
        5 + 5 + 5 = 15 or 5 x 3 = 15
        5 is repeatedly added 3 times

structure: 
    factor x factor = product
    
def factors: numbers being multiplied in a multiplication sentence (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:19).
    Example:    
        5 x 3 = 15
        5 and 3 are factors of 15

properties:
    commutative(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:53)
    distributive(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:54)(Khan Academy):
        4 * 7:
            4 * (5 + 2)
            4 * 5 + 4 * 2
            20 + 8
            ∴28
        
        6 * 9:
            6 * (6 + 3)
            6 * 6 + 6 * 3
            36 + 18
            ∴ 54

         6 * 9:
            6 * (10 - 1)
            6 * 10 - 6 * 1
            60 - 6
            ∴ 54
