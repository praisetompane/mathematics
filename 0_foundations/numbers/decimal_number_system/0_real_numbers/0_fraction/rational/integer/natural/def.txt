def natural numbers(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:2):
    - ℕ = {1,2,3,4,...}
    - remarks:
        also known as Counting numbers.

use cases:
    - count apples, goats etc.
    - solution to equations:
        example:
            given:
                equation₁: x + 1 = 5
            then:
                in Natural Numbers(i.e. ℕ), a solution exists (Censor, 2015):
                    solve equation:
                        x + 1 - 1 = 5 - 1 : substract 1 from both sides
                        then:
                            x = 5 - 1
                            x = 4
                        substituion test:
                            let x = 4
                                x + 1 = 5
                                4 + 1 = 5
                                5 = 5
                                which is true
