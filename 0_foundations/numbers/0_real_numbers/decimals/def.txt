def decimals: these are also based on 10(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
  The number line is split into 10 equal spaces/pieces between 2 digits(i.e. tenths)(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:3).
    e.g. 0 to 1 =
          0   s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s 1
                0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9
              10 's' between 0 and 1

          0 to 0.1
          s is split into 10 equal spaces as well(i.e hundredths)
          0   s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s|  s 0.1
              0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09

  system = ... ,tens, ones . tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths, hundred-thousandths, millionths, ...

    e.g. 13.453 = thirteen and four hundred fifty-three thousandths
            .453 is read like non decimal number + the ending place at the end
                  i.e. four hundred fifty-three  + thousandths
            "and" represents the decimal
          1.0034 = one and thirty-four ten thousandths

Q: Can we infinitely divide the space between 2 digits? [within a chosen base]
  Yes, that's how we get infinite decimals (i.e the irrational numbers.)


Q: are Rational and Irrational numbers decimal numbers?
