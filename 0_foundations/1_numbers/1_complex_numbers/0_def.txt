def complex numbers:
    formal:
        Let i = √-1 (Censor, 2015).
                ∴ i² = -1
        in words:

    plain english:

    intuition:

    examples:


def complex number set(Censor, 2015):
    formal:
        ℂ = {a + bi | a, b ∈ ℝ}

    example: 1 + 7i = complex number
 
example expression:
    2 + 3i² + 7i
    2 + 3(-1) + 7i
    2 - 3 + 7i
    -1 + 7i
    7i - 1

use case:
    solution to equations:
        x² = -1, has no solution in ℝ
        in complex field ℂ, a solution exists (Censor, 2015):
            x² = -1
            let x = i
            i² = -1
    
remark: in ℂ all equations have solutions.
            ℂ is an algebraically closed field.

def algebraically closed: TBD
