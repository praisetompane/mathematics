Mathematics begins with a blank/empty space(i.e. nothing)(Wildberger, 2009):
  - in it we introduce:
    - "|": NB: this be any symbol(i.e. O, (, etc))
        | represents a single entity:
            we name | as one
    
    - the idea of adding one(i.e."|") to itself.
        - | and | = ||
            we name || as two
        - this produces a sequence of |s

    - the idea of adding one to previously added ones(e.g. ||)
        example:
            || and | = |||
                we name ||| as three

    examples:
                        name
        |               one
        ||              two
        |||             three
        ||||            four
        |||||           five

def natural number(Wildberger, 2009): a string of ones(i.e. |)
    - properties:
        - they form a sequence(i.e. they are naturally ordered)
            - for every natural number, we can assign a "successor" S:
                example:
                    S(|) = || = successor of | is ||
                short form: ∀a,b ∈ ℕ, ∃b | S(a) = b    
            Q: Why do Natural numbers form a sequence?
                MYINC:
                    1. We start with |
                    2. to get || we require | to exist, because we add | to | to get ||.
                    3. to get ||| we require || to exist, because  we add | to || to get |||
                    They come into existence in an order.

    - remarks: 
        - this is our first Mathematical object.
        - all Mathematical objects are based on the natural numbers.

 

def numbers: names for quantities?

Q: Where/When did give these quantities names?
Q: Why do we count?
Q: When did we start counting?
Q: Did we always count upto ten as homo sapiens?
    hence base 10 system so natural?

Q: Where does the idea of "how many" things are there come from?
Q: Humans and other animals show case the ability to "know(by way of counting? Are there other ways to know how many things are there?" "how many" things are there.
Q: how many = numbers?
Q: does number theory tackle the origin of concept of "how many"?
Q: what is a number?
Q: what is counting?

Set Theory = successive functions:

number vs numeral¹
        57
            57 - decimal(base 10)
            111001 - binary
            LVII - roman numerals
numeral = representation/description of a number²
