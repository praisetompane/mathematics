Mathematics begins with a blank/empty space(i.e. nothing)(Wildberger, 2009):
  - in it we introduce:
    - "|": NB: this be any symbol(i.e. O, (, etc))
        | represents a single entity:
            we name | as one

        - remarks: 
            - this is our first Mathematical object.
            - all Mathematical objects are based on the natural numbers.
        
    - the idea of adding one(i.e."|") to itself.
        - | and | = ||
            we name || as two
        - this produces a string of |s

    - the idea of adding one to previously added ones(e.g. ||)
        example:
            || and | = |||
                we name ||| as three

    examples:
        |s              name
        |               one
        ||              two
        |||             three
        ||||            four
        |||||           five

def natural number(Wildberger, 2009): a string of ones(i.e. |)

def natural numbers(Wildberger, 2009): a collection of these strings of ones.
    - properties:
        - they form a sequence(i.e. they are naturally ordered):
            - for every natural number, we can associate/define/determine a "successor":
                example:
                    S(|) = || = successor of | is ||
                short form: ∀a,b ∈ ℕ, ∃b | S(a) = b    
                remark: this is our first Mathematical operator.
            Q: Why do Natural numbers form a sequence?
                MYINC:
                    1. We start with |
                    2. to get || we require | to exist, because we add | to | to get ||.
                    3. to get ||| we require || to exist, because  we add | to || to get |||
                    They come into existence in an order.
        - relative size of natural numbers:
            - i.e. which number is bigger than another?
            example:
                given: two numbers
                        ||||
                        ||||||
                then:
                        pair each one(i.e. |) in one number with a one in the other number.
                then:
                        the number left with unpaired ones is the larger of the two.
            - abstract notation:
                let:
                    - n and m be natural numbers
                then:
                    - equality:
                        n = m, if and only if, |s in n match |s in m
                            remark: this is our second Mathematical operator.
                    - inequality:
                        n < m , if and only if, |s in n are less than |s in m
                            remark: this is our third Mathematical operator.


def numbers: names for quantities?

Q: Where/When did give these quantities names?
Q: Why do we count?
Q: When did we start counting?
Q: Did we always count upto ten as homo sapiens?
    hence base 10 system so natural?

Q: Where does the idea of "how many" things are there come from?
Q: Humans and other animals show case the ability to "know(by way of counting? Are there other ways to know how many things are there?" "how many" things are there.
Q: how many = numbers?
Q: does number theory tackle the origin of concept of "how many"?
Q: what is a number?
Q: what is counting?

Set Theory = successive functions:

number vs numeral¹
        57
            57 - decimal(base 10)
            111001 - binary
            LVII - roman numerals
numeral = representation/description of a number²
