def natural numbers¹(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:2):
    ℕ = {1,2,3,4,...}    = Natural Numbers = Used when we needed to count apples, goats etc.
    remarks:
      also known as Counting numbers.
      
def natural numbers²(Wildberger, 2009): a collection of these strings of ones.
    - properties:
        - they form a sequence(i.e. they are naturally ordered):
            - for every natural number, we can associate/define/determine a "successor":
                example:
                    S(|) = || = successor of | is ||
                short form: ∀a,b ∈ ℕ, ∃b | S(a) = b    
                remark: this is our first Mathematical operator.
            Q: Why do Natural numbers form a sequence?
                MYINC:
                    1. We start with |
                    2. to get || we require | to exist, because we add | to | to get ||.
                    3. to get ||| we require || to exist, because  we add | to || to get |||
                    They come into existence in an order.
        - relative size of natural numbers:
            - i.e. which number is bigger than another?
            example:
                given: two numbers
                        ||||
                        ||||||
                then:
                        pair each one(i.e. |) in one number with a one in the other number.
                then:
                        the number left with unpaired ones is the larger of the two.
            - abstract notation:
                let:
                    - n and m be natural numbers
                then:
                    - equality:
                        n = m, if and only if, |s in n match |s in m
                            remark: this is our second Mathematical operator.
                    - inequality:
                        n < m , if and only if, |s in n are less than |s in m
                            remark: this is our third Mathematical operator.
