def number: ???
    names for quantities?

def natural number (Wildberger, 2009): a string of ones(i.e. one = |)

def natural numbers(Wildberger, 2009): a collection(i.e. Set) of these strings of ones.
    - properties:
        - they form a sequence(i.e. they are naturally ordered):
            - for every natural number, we can associate/define/determine a "successor":
                example:
                    S(|) = || = successor of | is ||

                short form: ∀a,b ∈ ℕ, ∃b | S(a) = b ∧ b = a + |
                
                remark: this is our first Mathematical operator.

            Q: Why do Natural numbers form a sequence?
                MYINC:
                    1. We start with |
                    2. to get || we require | to exist, because we add | to | to get ||.
                    3. to get ||| we require || to exist, because  we add | to || to get |||
                    They come into existence in an order.

        - relative size of natural numbers:
            - i.e. which number is bigger than another?
                example:
                    given: two numbers
                            ||||
                            ||||||
                    then:
                            pair each one(i.e. |) in one number with a one in the other number.
                    then:
                            the number left with unpaired ones is the larger of the two.
            - abstract notation:
                let:
                    - n and m be natural numbers
                then:
                    - equality:
                        n = m, if and only if, |s in n match |s in m
                            remark: this is our second Mathematical operator.
                    - inequality:
                        n < m , if and only if, |s in n are less than |s in m
                            remark: this is our third Mathematical operator.

number vs numeral(Hamkins, 2020)
    example:
        number = fifty seven
        numerals:
            57 - decimal(base 10)
            111001 - binary
            LVII - roman numerals

Qs:
    Q: Where/When did give these quantities names?
    Q: Why do we count?
    Q: When did we start counting?
    Q: Did we always count upto ten as homo sapiens?
        hence base 10 system so natural?

    Q: Where does the idea of "how many" things are there come from?
    Q: Humans and other animals show case the ability to "know(by way of counting? Are there other ways to know how many things are there?" "how many" things are there.
    Q: how many = numbers?
    Q: does number theory tackle the origin of concept of "how many"?
    Q: what is a number?
    Q: what is counting?
