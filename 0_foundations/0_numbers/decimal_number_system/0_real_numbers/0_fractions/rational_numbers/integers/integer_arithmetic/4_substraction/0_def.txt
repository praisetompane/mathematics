def substraction: the opposite of addition
    the act of removing quantity from a place value(i.e. ...,the hundreds ,the tens, the ones, the tenths, the hundredths,...)
        during this act: 
            if the quantity to remove exceeds the quantity in the current place value
                we convert 1(one) quantity of the next higher place, into the current place value
                    the conversion = the 1(one) quantity * base of the number system(often 10) + 
                                     quantity in current place value
