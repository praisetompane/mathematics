def arithmetic:
    formal(Courant, Robbins, 1941:1-2):

        in words:
            the mathematical theory of natural numbers or positive integers (i.e. ℕ).

            fundamental lows(axioms) of arithmetic:
                a,b,c ∈ : a,b,c are positive numbers
                1. a + b = b + a                : commutativity of addition
                2. a × b = b × a                : commutativity of multiplication
                3. a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c    : associativity of addition
                4. a × (b × c) = (a × b) × c    : associativity of multiplication
                5. a × (b + c) = a×b + a×c      : distributivity of addition and multiplication
