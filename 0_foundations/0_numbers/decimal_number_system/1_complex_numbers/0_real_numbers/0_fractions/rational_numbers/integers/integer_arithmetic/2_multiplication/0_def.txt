def multiplication¹(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:19):
    - formal:
        - in words:
            repeated addition(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:19)
                of multiple equal groups of something(Khan Academy)
        
        - examples:  
            3 groups of five
            3 fives 
            5 + 5 + 5 = 15 or 5 x 3 = 15
            5 is repeatedly added 3 times

    - plain english:

    - intuition:

    - properties:
        - factors: numbers being multiplied in a multiplication sentence (Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:19).
            - example:    
                5 x 3 = 15
                5 and 3 are factors of 15
        - structure: 
            factor x factor = product
