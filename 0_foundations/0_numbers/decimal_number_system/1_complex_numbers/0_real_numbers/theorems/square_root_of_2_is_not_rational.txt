theorem: √2 ∉ ℚ (Censor, 2013)
    Let:
        √2 ∈ ℚ
            with √2 = m/n expressed in reduced form, where m,n ∈ ℤ and n ≠ 0.
            then m and n do not have common factors.
    Then:
        proof steps:
            type: proof by contradiction.

            0. √2 = m/n  
            1. (√2)² = m²/n²                    : square each side of the equation.
                result: 2 = m²/n²
            2. 2 = m²/n²                        : multiply each side of the equation with n²/1.   
                result: m² = 2n²

            3. m² = 2n² => m² is even           : because 2n² is divisible by 2 and therefore even.
                                                  m² has to be even since it is eqaul 2n²(which is even).

            4. m² is even => m is even          : because only an even number can be squared to produce another even number.
            
            5. 2n² is even                      : because any number mupliplied by 2 is even.

            3. 2n² = m² => 2n² is even          : because any number mupliplied by 2 is even.
            4. 2n² is even => m² is even        : because 2n² is even, m² has to be even for them to be equal.
            5. 2n² is even => 
            6. 

            5. m² and 2n² being even means they are divisible by 2, therefore are not 
                                they are not in lowest terms and have a common factor of 2.
                        this contradicts our initial conditions that they are in lowest form and no common factors.
            ∴ √2 ∉ Q
