theorem: √2 ∉ ℚ (Censor, 2013)
    assume √2 ∈ ℚ, then √2 = m/n, expressed in lowest form.

    proof steps:
        type: proof by contradiction.

        initial claim: √2 = m/n          
    
        1. (√2)² = m²/n² = 2 = m²/n²: square each side of the equation
        2. 2n² = m² : multiply each side of the equation with n²/1         
        3. 2n² = m² => 2n² is even : because any number mupliplied by 2 is even
        4. 2n² is even => m²: because 2n² is even, m² has to be even for them to be equal
        5. m² and 2n² being even means they are divisible by 2, therefore not 
                            they are not in lowest terms.
                      this contradicts our initial conditions that they are in lowest form. 
        ∴ √2 ∉ Q
