def cardinal number or cardinal or cardinality or size(Hammack, 2018:4):
    formal:
        for a finite set, it is denoted as |SET|
            example:
                Let:
                    A = {}
                Then:
                    cardinality of A is |A|
        in words:

    plain english:  
                number of elements in a set.
                    for finite sets, this number is in ℕ (ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᴼⁿ_ⁿᵉᵉᵈ)
                        i.e. it is a Natural number.

                            notation:
                                A = {}
                                |A| := cardinality of set A

    plain english:
        number of elements in an infinite set.
            this number is in the infinite cardinals(ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᴼⁿ_ⁿᵉᵉᵈ).
