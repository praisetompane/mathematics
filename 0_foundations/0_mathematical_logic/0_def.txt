            - avoid paradoxes.
        - can be studied in logic as mathematical objects which allows:

                example: Gödel’s theorem.
        - computers can manipulate formal symbols which allows:
            - computer proof verification.

            components:

    use cases/value proposition:
        - create a solid foundation for mathematics to:
            - avoid paradoxes.
        - formal systems can be studied in logic as mathematical objects which allows:

def foundations of mathematics (Kunen, 2007:5):
    - involves/uses the axiomatic method.

        def axiomatic method (Kunen, 2007:5): we define/select axioms then
                                                proof theorems from the axioms.

            NB: the justification for the axioms
                    is part of the motivation or physics or philosophy
                    NOT part of the Mathematics itself.

                the mathematics itself
                    consists of logical deductions
                        from axioms (Kunen, 2007:5).

        - types of uses of the concept/word "axioms" (Kunen, 2007:47) NB: 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠:
            - statements of faith
            - definitional axioms

            def statements of faith:
                - statements that are obviously true,
                    and thus require no proof.
                - closest to truism.

                example:
                    Greek Classical View:
                        make observations about Real Physical Space
                            which are obviously true.
                        from them we can derive other 
                            non-obvious facts.
                        
                        therefore
                            by studying Euclidean Geometry 
                                one is studying structure of the real world.

                            NB: Later Euclid's axioms were reduced to definitional ones;
                                    as one way to describe a specific(flat) geometry.
                                
                                We learned his Geometry only approximates the Real Physical space
                                    and there are other Geometries
                                        predicated on different axioms.
                        
                        Something Interesting: The other non-obvious facts
                                                    are derived without observation of the Physical Space.
                        
            def definitional axioms:
                - defines a useful class of structure.
                - captures the structure of things/ideas and proves theorems about them.
                    NB: One finds various instances of these things/ideas 
                            in various domains.
                            domains = {Mathematics, Real Physical Space, Computation, ...}
                - common in algebra

                example:
                    axioms of Groups define/captures what a Group is.
                        see: 1_algebra/1_group/0_def.txt
                        instances of Group:
                            {
                                (ℤ,+) = The Integers with respect to addition.
                            }
                    
                    axioms of fields define/captures what a Field is: 
                        see: 1_algebra/2_field/0_def.txt
                        instances of Fields:
                            {   (ℝ, +, ×) = The Real Numbers with respect to addition and multiplication,
                                (ℂ, +, ×) = The Complex Numbers with respect to addition and multiplication,
                                (ℚ, +, ×) = The Rational Numbers with respect to addition and multiplication,
                                ...
                            }

        - axiomatic method examples(Kunen, 2007:5-9):
            - Geometry (Kunen, 2007:5):
                - these are definitional axioms.
                    - they were statements of faith in Euclid's Geometry prior to Einstein's advances in Physics.

                Euclid Postulate(axiom) 1:
                    ∀x,y[Point(x) ∧ Point(y) ∧ x ≠ y] ⟹ ∃!z[Line(z) ∧ LiesOn(x,z) ∧ LiesOn(y,z)]
                        domain of discourse = all geometric objects.

                    english: any two distinct points
                                determine a unique line.

            - Group Theory (Kunen, 2007:6):
                - these are definitional axioms.
                - based on these axioms: see: 1_algebra/1_group/0_def.txt
                    GP is a 𝑠𝑒𝑡 of two sentences in 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑐  
                example:
                    𝐺𝑃 implies the cancellation rule:
                        𝐺𝑃 ⊢ ∀x,y[x ∘ y = x ∘ z ⟹ y = z]

            - Set Theory (Kunen, 2007:7): 
                - these are definitional axioms.
                - based on Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice axiom (ZFC).
                - all of modern Mathematics is subsumed within Set theory.

    - defines these objects (Kunen, 2007:6-7):
        def mathematical proof:

        def mathematical statement:

        def syntax:

        def semantics: involves meaning or 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠 such as groups.

        def Completeness Theorem:
            - relates syntax and semantics
    
    NB: every list of formal sentences
            forms the axioms of some axiomatic theory (Kunen, 2007:7).
