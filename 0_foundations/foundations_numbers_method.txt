def foundations of mathematics:
    Mathematics begins with a blank/empty space(i.e. nothing)(Wildberger, 2009):
    - in it we introduce:
        - "|": NB: this be any symbol(i.e. O, (, etc))
            | represents a single entity:
                we name | as one

            - remarks: 
                - this is our first Mathematical object.
                - all Mathematical objects are based on the natural numbers.

            Q: do we require natural language to create Mathematics?
            
        - the idea of adding one(i.e."|") to itself.
            - | and | = ||
                we name || as two
            - this produces a string of |s

        - the idea of adding one to previously added ones(e.g. ||)
            example:
                || and | = |||
                    we name ||| as three

        examples:
            |s              name
            |               one
            ||              two
            |||             three
            ||||            four
            |||||           five
