def: 
    placeholders for when:
        - you want to talk about something and imagine it has more than one value
            BUT do not know all the possible values (Epp, 2010:1).
        - you want to make assertions about it that are true for all elements in a given set (Epp, 2010:2).

exmples (Epp, 2010:2) :
    - Are there numbers with the property that the sum of their squares equals the square of their sum?
        - are there numbers a, b such that a² + b² = (a + b)² ?
        - are there numbers a₁, a₂, a₃, ...aₙ such that 
            a₁² + a₂² + a₃² + ... + aₙ² = (a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... + aₙ)²? 
    
    - Given any real number, its square is nonnegative (Epp, 2010:2). 
        - for all real numbers n, n² >= 0
        - for any real number n, n² >= 0
