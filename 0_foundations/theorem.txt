def theorem:
    formal: a mathematical fact that is proved (Censor, 2013).

    plain english: a sentence
                    that is proved to be true.

    structure (Censor, 2013):
        - context/assumptions/setting/data
            e.g. let, suppose
        
        - conclusion/consequence/result
            e.g. Then some thing is True/ Therefore some thing is True
            
            NB: This is what requires proof.
