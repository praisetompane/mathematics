def foundations of mathematics (Kunen, 2007:5):
    - involves/uses the axiomatic method.

        def axiomatic method (Kunen, 2007:5): we define/select axioms then
                                                proof theorems from the axioms.

            NB: the justification for the axioms
                    is part of the motivation or physics or philosophy
                    NOT part of the Mathematics itself.
                the mathematics itself
                    consists of logical deductions
                        from axioms (Kunen, 2007:5).
    
    - defines these objects (Kunen, 2007:6-7):
        def mathematical proof:

        def mathematical statement:

        def syntax:

        def semantics: involves meaning or 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠 such as groups.

        def Completeness Theorem:
            - relates syntax and semantics

    axiomatic method examples:
        - Geometry (Kunen, 2007:5)
            Euclid Postulate(axiom) 1:
                ∀x,y[Point(x) ∧ Point(y) ∧ x ≠ y] ⟹ ∃!z[Line(z) ∧ LiesOn(x,z) ∧ LiesOn(y,z)]
                    domain of discourse = all geometric objects.

                english: any two distinct points
                            determine a unique line.

        - Group Theory: based on these axioms: see: 1_algebra/1_group/0_def.txt
            example:
                𝐺𝑃 implies the cancellation ruls:
                    𝐺𝑃 ⊢ ∀x,y[x ∘ y = x ∘ z ⟹ y = z]

        - Set Theory: ???
    
def predicate logic: a formal language
                        with precise rules of formation. 
                        just like computer programming languages(C, Java, etx) (Kunen, 2007:6).

    def formal proof (Kunen, 2007:6): a finite sequence of sentences
                                        written in this language
                                        that obey 
                                            a precisely defined rule of inference.
                                            rules of inference = {modus ponens, ...}

    syntactic objects (Kunen, 2007:6):
        - predicate logic sentences
        - formal proofs
