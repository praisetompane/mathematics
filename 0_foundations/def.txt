def foundations(Kunen, 2007:5):
    - the foundations of mathematics
        involves the axiomatic method.
    - we define/select axioms
        proof theorems from the axioms.

    NB: the justification for the axioms
            is part of the motivation or physics or philosophy
            NOT part of the Mathematics itself.
        the mathematics itself
            consists of logical deductions
                from axioms (Kunen, 2007:5).

    axiomatic method examples:
        - Geometry (Kunen, 2007:5)
            Euclid Postulate(axiom) 1:
                ∀x,y[Point(x) ∧ Point(y) ∧ x ≠ y] ⟹ ∃!z[Line(z) ∧ LiesOn(x,z) ∧ LiesOn(y,z)]
                    domain of discourse = all geometric objects.

                english: any two distinct points
                            determine a unique line.

        - Group Theory: ???
