def foundations(Kunen, 2007:5):
    - the foundations of mathematics
        involves the axiomatic method.
    - we define/select axioms
        proof theorems from the axioms.

    NB: the justification for the axioms
            is part of the motivation or physics or philosophy
            NOT part of the Mathematics itself.
        the mathematics itself
            consists of logical deductions
                from axioms.
