def Fermat or Interior Extremum (Censor, 2013):
    - formal:
        Let: 
            f(x) be defined in (a,b)
            AND let x₀ be a maximum or minimum point
                at which f is differentiable.
        Then:
            f'(x₀) = 0.

    - properties:
        - f(x) = function

            formal:
                f(x₀) ≥ f(x), ∀x ∈ (a,b)

                in words: the value of f at x₀ (i.e. f(x₀))
                            is greater or equal
                                to all values of f 
                                    at all values of x in the range (a,b)

            plain english: the point at which 
                                a function reaches its biggest value.
