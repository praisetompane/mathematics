def Cauchy (Censor, 2013):
    - formal
        Let: 
            f(ùë•) and g(x) 
                be continuous on [a,b]
                AND differentiable on (a,b).

            Assume that:
                ‚àÄx ‚àà (a,b), g'(x) ‚â† 0.

        Then
            1. g(a) ‚â† g(b)
            2. ‚àÉc ‚àà (a,b)
                such that:
                   f'(c)    f(b) - f(a)
                   ----- =  -----------
                   g'(c)    g(b) - g(a)

        - generalizes Legrange's theorem:
            solution:
                Let g(x) = x : a straight line

                f'(c)    f(b) - f(a)
                ----- =  -----------
                g'(c)    g(b) - g(a)


                f'(c)    f(b) - f(a)
                ----- =  -----------
                  1      g(b) - g(a)  : g'(c) = 1:
                                            - because the derivative of x is 1
                                            - because the derivitive of a stright line function at any point is 1.
                                                i.e. its slope is 1(i.e. the rate of change between the points is 1)

                         f(b) - f(a)
                f'(c) =  -----------  : anything numerator divided by 1, equals the numberator
                         g(b) - g(a) 


                         f(b) - f(a)
                f'(c) =  ----------- 
                           b - a      : because g(b) = b and g(a) = a since g is defined as g(x) = x.
                                            i.e. returns/equals the same value of its parameter.

                    NB: This equation is Legrange's thereom.
