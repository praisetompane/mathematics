def calculus: relates two functions,
                - distance and speed
                - height and slope ⁽ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᴼⁿ_ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ⁾.

    - Fermat (Censor, 2015):
        formal:
            let f(x) be defined in/on (a, b)
            AND let x₀ be a maximum or minimum point
                at which f is differentiable.
            Then f'(x₀) = 0.
