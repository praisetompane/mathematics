def calculus: relates two functions,
                - distance and speed
                - height and slope ⁽ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᴼⁿ_ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ⁾.

theorems:
    - Fermat or Interior Extremum (Censor, 2015):
        formal:
            let f(x) be defined in/on (a, b)
            AND let x₀ be a maximum or minimum point
                at which f is differentiable.
            Then f'(x₀) = 0.

            components:

                def maximum: 
                    formal:
                        f(x₀) ≥ f(x), ∀x ∈ (a,b)

                        in words: the value of f at x₀ (i.e. f(x₀))
                                    is greater or equal
                                        to all values of f 
                                            at all values of x in the range (a,b)

                    plain english: the point at which 
                                        a function reaches its biggest value.
