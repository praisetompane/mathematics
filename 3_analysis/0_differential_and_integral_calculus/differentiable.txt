- def differentiable(Censor, 2013):
    - formal
        - TBD
    - plain english:
        - graph/chart of the function has no cusps(pointy/sharp sections)(i.e. it is smooth)
    - intuition: for a function to be differentiable
                        the graph of the function
                            is smooth (has no cusps).
