Problem: Often attempt to describe/estimate an unknown value by a single value(e.g Mean)(Guttag, 2016)
    Better approach: Confidence Intervals

- Confidence Levels and Intervals
    def: RANGE OF VALUES within which the unknown value is likely to exist
         and the CONFIDENCE that it will exist in the range.
    
        e.g. For 20 trials
                For 100 spins of Roulette
                        Expect your return will be between 1% and -1%
                        95% of the time

        Properties:
            The smaller the range = BETTER constraint range
                    âˆ´ good reason to believe
                        computed Mean is closer to the True Mean.

        NB: As Trials approach infinity, the simulated Mean approaches True Mean.

    Calculation/Computation Methods:
        - Empirical rule
        - 

        - Empirical rule
            - Assumptions required for rule to work:
                - The Mean estimation error is zero(0)
                    i.e. Equally likely to guess High or Low
                - The Distribution of the errors in the estimate is NORMAL(i.e. Gaussian distribution)
                    See 4_distributions.txt for definitions.
            def: 
                Given 
                    data
                    Mean of data
                    Standard deviation of data
                Then
                    ~66% of data will be within 1 standard deviations of Mean
                    ~95% of data will be within 1.96 standard deviations Mean
                    ~99.7% of data will be within 3 standard deviations of Mean
