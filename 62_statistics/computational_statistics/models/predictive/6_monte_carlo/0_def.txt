a method for estimating a unknown value 
    using inferential statistics (Guttag, 2016).

componentsÂ²:
    population: universe of possible examples
    sample: a proper subset of the population. 
        proper: > 0 < population
        KEY: HAS TO BE RANDOM.
        KEY: a random sample tends to exhibits the same properties of population.
