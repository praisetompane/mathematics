def: model: an experimental device that can help us understand something/data that (Guttag, 2016):
    - has happened
    - hasn't happened(predict the future)

def computation model: how can we use computation to help us understand the world/things (Guttag, 2016).
    
Kinds of models (Guttag, 2016):
    Prescriptive = tell you WHAT to DO to get an effect
        1. Optimization
        In order to make this happen(effect), you must do DO this
    
    Descriptive = describes/shows possible effect/outcomes (NOT how to achieve an effect/outcome)
        3. Simulation
        if I do this, here is what happens(effect)
        when to use:
            mathematically intractable problems/effects
            get intermediate results to an effect
            answer increasingly more complex what if questions
    
    Predictive?: predict what will happen
                example: predict the value of an unknown quantity or random variable
        
    2. Statistical
