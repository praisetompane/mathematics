    What is the probability of people sharing a birthday?

    Given
        367 people
    Then
        p = 1
        by way of pigeon hole principle
            i.e. There are 367 people(birthdays) and ONLY 366 holes(dates)
                ∴ 2 people WILL HAVE TO share a hole(birthday)

    Analytic Solution:
        Assumption: Each birthday is EQUALLY LIKELY
                366!
        1 - ---------------
            366ᴺ * (366-N)!
