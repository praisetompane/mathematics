until ~20 Century¹ 
    World believed to be causally deterministic
    i.e. The future state of a physical system can be computed from its current state(Guttag, 2016).

post 20ᵗʰ Century² (Guttag, 2016):
    Copenhagen Doctrine (Bohr and Heisenberg) 
        The physical world at the most fundamental level is not causally deterministic(i.e causal nondeterminism)
            i.e. Nothing has a probability of 1
            i.e. We can state that "something is VERY LIKELY to occur"
                but NEVER that "something WILL occur"
                
                i.e. Probabilistic statements.
def predictive nondeterminism: Our INABILITY to get PRECISE MEASUREMENTS of the world
                                makes it IMPOSSIBLE to make PRECISE PREDICTIONS about its FUTURE STATES(Guttag, 2016).³ 

    the fact that we(observers), do not have all(complete) information about the world, suggest we must treat it as inherently unpredictable.
    
NB: This is the world we are trying to write computations about, to understand it.
    i.e. nondeterministic computations
