Model to understand scenarios where you have:
        - objective: 
            the thing you want to achieve/do/complete or a measurable value, condition etc

            - objective function
                either to minimize or maximize

        - set of constraints
            can be empty
            - eliminates solutions

problem pattern: find the biggest, smallest, lowest, highest, fewest, fastest, least expensive etc
                    with some constraints(can be none)

    Examples: Going to Cape Town from Jozi either by Bus/Train/Flight    
        - Given:
                Flight cost = 2 hours, R1000
                Train = 168 hours, R250
                Bus = 72 hours, R450
        
        - objective: Get to Cape Town from Jozi quickly
            - objective function: minimize number of minutes spent in transit
        
        - set of constraints:
            only have R500 to spend
        
        âˆ´   Bus route, 72 hours at R450 cost
    
            (Flight, 2 hours) < ((Bus, 72 hours), (Train, 168 hours))
                (Flight, R1000) > (Constraint, R450)

            (Bus, 72 hours) < (Train, 168 hours)
                (Bus, R450) < (R500, Contraint)
