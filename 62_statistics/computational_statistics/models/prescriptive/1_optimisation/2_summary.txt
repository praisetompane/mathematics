Many problems can be modelled/represented as optimisation problem

Optimisation problems are inherently exponential in complexity

Greedy algorithm can solve the problem FASTER, but do not always provde the optimal solution

Brute force algorithm + memoisation solve this exponentially hard problem:
    - provides correct(optimal) solution
    - often fast under correct circumstances.
        i.e. the problem space has "memoisable"(see above) states(i.e. nodes, subproblems etc).
