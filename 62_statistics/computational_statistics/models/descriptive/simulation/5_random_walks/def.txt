def 1 a mathematical object
    that describes a path across a mathematical space
        defined by a succession of random steps¹ 

def 2 a process by which
        randomly moving objects
            wander away from their initial positions² 


use cases³ :
    model:
        physical processes(e.g. diffusion)
        biological processes(e.g. the kinetics of the displace of RNA)
        social processes(e.g. movement of stock market)

types:
    - standard/"normal"
    - biased

    - standard/"normal": all possible random step choices are equally likely to happen.
    - biased: certain step choices are more desired, therefore more likely to happen.
                e.g. highly weighted
              desired step choices have greater effect
                e.g. Given, we want to end in South
                     Then, walk more steps in desired direction(1 step if direction north, but 2 if direction south)

Examples Random Walk⁴: 
    - Brownian motion
    - drunkard's walk:
        Given:
            A drunk
                can walk 1 step in random direction
                
        If she were to take 1000 times, 
            would she go further away from the initial position(origin)
            OR
            would she end up wander back to the origin over and over again?

            ANS: We need simulation for this, as she takes random steps. There is no way to analytically calculate/compute 
                the answer.
                BECAUSE her steps are random.


        How far is she from initial position?
            Build the simplified version to gain intuition:
                Assumptions:
                    movement is in 2D Cartesian space
                    movement is 1 step parallel to x or y axis

                0.25 probability she is back to initial position(i.e. move backward)
                0.25 probability she is 2 steps from initial position(i.e. took another step in previous' step direction)
                0.5 probability she is sqrt(2) from initial position: 
                    Q: Why/How probability of 0.5?
                    i.e. uses Pythagoras
                    h = sqrt(horizontal² + vertical²)
                        sqrt(1² + 1²)
                        sqrt(1 + 1)
                        sqrt(2)

                    h is the diagonal from initial position to where the point where "up" move from the "left" move
                        would position her.

                             /|
                        h   / | length = 1(i.e vertical move)
                           ----
                        length = 1(i.e. horizontal move)

                        h² = horizontal² + vertical²
                        h = sqrt(horizontal² + vertical²)
