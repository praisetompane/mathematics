Given 6 plants with heights:
    4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7

    Question: How tall are your plants, given as one number?
                    
    Ans: Average => typical number or 
                    middle number or 
                    center number or
                    frequent number => Find Measure of Central tendency.

types of Measures of Central tendency(i.e. Averages) (KhanAcademy):
    1. Arithmetic Mean = Sum of all numbers/Number of numbers. 
        NB: Human constructed definition we've found useful(unlike the
        circumference of circle, π, etc which exist in the mathematical universe)

        (4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7)/6 = 22/6 = 3*4/6 = 3*2/3 NB: In mixed number form
        
        NB: Used frequently
        Key: If the total quantity was distributed evenly in the dataset,
            the Mean is the quantity that each "position(i.e. index 0,1,2,...n)" would have  (KhanAcademy). 
            
    2. Median = Middle number in the ordered(ascending) version of the dataset. 
        algorithm:
            If odd number count, take middle number
            Else even number count, take Arithmetic Mean of the two middle numbers
            
        
        1, 1, 3, 4, 6 ,7
            ∴ Median = (3 + 4)/2 = 7/2 = 3*1/2

        0, 7, 50, 10000, 100000
            ∴ Median = 50

        NB: Useful when some large number might skew the Arithmetic Mean

    3. Mode = Most frequent number in the dataset. 
        algorithm:
            count occurences of each number
            find number with highest occurence count
                if no single number has the highest frequency, then
                    the dataset has no mode

        1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
            ∴ Mode = 1

        1, 6, 3, 9, 8
            ∴ Mode = None
