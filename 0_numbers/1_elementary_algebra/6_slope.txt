def slope (Khan Academy):
    formal: 
        Δy/Δx
    plain english:
        - how much change
            happens in 𝑦
                for a change in 𝑥
            NB: It is a ratio of the change in y with respect to/proportional to the change in x.
            Q: f(Δx) -> Δy
                is slope a function f,
                    from a Δ in 𝑥 to a Δ in y?: No, it is a ratio.
        - how steep a line is.
        - how quickly does it increase
        - how quickly does it decrease
