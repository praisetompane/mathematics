def integers:
    Measurement(Kent State Department of Mathematical Sciences, 2008:2):
    * ℤ = {...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3...} = Integers = Used when measurements/counts below zero we needed.
    ∴ ℤ ⊂ ℝ
        <---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--->
            -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3

Q: Why isn't there a -0(i.e. negative zero?)
