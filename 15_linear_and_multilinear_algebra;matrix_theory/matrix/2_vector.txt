def vector(Sanderson, 2016):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: 
      - an entity with a magnitude and direction

      - physics:
          an arrow with a:
              direction
              length (Sanderson, 2016).
      - mathematics:
          anything with a sensible notion of:
              addition of two vectors
              multiplication of a vector by a number(scalar) (Sanderson, 2016).

      - computer science:
          list of numbers (Sanderson, 2016).
          e.g | 1 |
              | 4 |

              || = []

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

      - addition and subtraction: add/subtract corresponding components

        why does the order of terms matter in addition and subtraction?

          (a) - (b) != (b) - (a)
          (a) +  (b) != (b) + (a)

      - multiplication/division: ???

      - unit vectors:
        - a vector with a magnitude of 1

        - getting the unit vector of another vector (vector in the same direction with
        a magnitude of 1):

          1. divide the components of the vector by the magnitude of the vector

              a = (3,4)
              ||a|| = 5
              {
                sqrt(3^2 + 4 ^2)
                sqrt(9 + 16)
                sqrt(25)
                = 5
                :apply pythagoras theorem
              }

              u = (3/5, 4/5) : (out unit vector)

              proof(get magnitude using pythagoras theorem)

            ||u||=
            {
                sqrt( (3/5)^2 + (4/5)^2 )
                sqrt( 9/25 + 16/ 25)
                sqrt(25/25)
                sqrt(1) = 1 : correct
            }
