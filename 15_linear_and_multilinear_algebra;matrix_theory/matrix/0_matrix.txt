        - in words: ???

    - plain english: square or rectangle of numbers, with special features.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: 
        - types (Strang, 2020):
            - columns and rows in the same direction
            - rank 2 matrix
            - symmetric matrix
            - orthogonal matrix (perpendicular)

            - columns and rows in the same direction:
                Example:
                    A₀ = [  1 3  2
                            4 12 8
                            2 6  4 
                        ]
                    
                        row_2 = 4 * row_1. NB: Is it just row 1 scaled by 4
                                = 2 * row_3. NB: Is it just row 3 scaled by 2
                        row_3 = 2 * row_1. NB: Is it just row 1 scaled by 2
                        
                        NB: The "vectors" are pointing in the same direction.
                            They just have different magnitude(length)

                        col_2 = 3 * col_1. NB: Is it just col 1 scaled by 3
                        col_3 = 2 * col_1. NB: It is just col 1 scaled by 2

                        OBSERVATION⁴:
                            When the rows are in the same direction, the columns are too.

            - orthogonal matrix (perpendicular):
                expresses rotation of the plane.

            - A = CR : Independent columns  |   |
                                            |   | * |       |
                                            |   |
                a matrix A is a product of a Column matrix(C) and row matrix(R)
            
            - A = LU : Triangular matrices L and U  |\ o |        |\   |
                                                    | \  |    *   | \  |
                                                    |  \ |        |  \ |
                                                    |   \|        | o \|
            
            - A = QR: Orthogonal columns in Q       |    |        |\   |
                                                    |q₁qₙ|    *   | \  |
                                                    |    |        |  \ |

def matrix²(Censor, 2015): 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: 
            a chart of elements 
                arranged in
                    rows and columns

    
    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???
    
    - properties:
        - general form:
                𝐴 = (
                    𝑎₁₁ 𝑎₁₂ 𝑎₁₃ ... 𝑎₁ₙ
                    𝑎₂₁ 𝑎₂₂ 𝑎₂₃ ... 𝑎₂ₙ
                    𝑎₃₁ 𝑎₃₂ 𝑎₃₃ ... 𝑎₃ₙ

                    .    .   .       .
                    𝑎ₘ₁  𝑎ₘ₂ 𝑎ₘ₃ ...  𝑎ₘₙ 
                    )

                NB: MYINC: the columns are fixed forall m in the general form.
                    Question: Is this an interesting property?
                
                notation:
                    - aᵢⱼ is the entry in:
                        - row i
                        - column j
                        of the matrix
                    - 𝐴 = Aₘₓₙ = (aᵢⱼ)
                        - matrix 𝐴 has m rows AND n columns
                    - 𝐴 ∈ Mₘₓₙ(ℂ)
                        - Mₘₓₙ = family of m × n matrices
                        - Mₘₓₙ(ℂ) = family of m × n matrices over the Complex Numbers
                        ∴ 𝐴 ∈ Mₘₓₙ(ℂ) = 𝐴 is a member of m × n matrices over the Complex Numbers
                    - if m = n, then
                        𝐴 ∈ Mₙ(ℂ)
                        - Mₙ = shorthand for Mₙₓₙ

                    - concepts:
                        - size of matrix: m × n
                            - m = number of rows
                            - n = number of columns
                        - square matrix: 𝐴 = Aₙₓₙ
                        - main diagonal: all elements aᵢᵢ
                            NB: i AND j = same value
                                example:
                                    given 𝐴 = A₃ₓ₃
                                    main diagonal = a₁₁, a₂₂, a₃₃ 
                            NB: usually only associated with square matrices
                                    because row AND column numbers are equal
                                        therefore a full diagonal form
                                            a₁₁ to aᵢᵢ is possible
                                    NB: in a rectangular matrix, this is not possible,
                                            eventually we reach an entry aₘₙ where,
                                                n > m
                                                example:
                                                    in 𝐴 = A₂ₓ₃
    - examples:
        𝐴 = ( 
              1  0 π 
              √2 𝑖 -3    
            )

        𝐴 is a matrix over ℂ
