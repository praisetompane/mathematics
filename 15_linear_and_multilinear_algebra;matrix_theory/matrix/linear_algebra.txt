    physics:
      - arrows pointing in space:
        - properties:/magnitude
          - length
          - direction
        - examples:
          v = ->
          w = ->
          y = <-
          ∴ 
            v = w
            y ≠ v ≠ w
    computer science:
      - list of numbers
        - example:
          v = [1, 6]
          w = [7, 9]
          y = [1, 6]
          ∴
            v ≠ w
            v = w

      - any object with support for these operations:

          - example:
            - v + w
         - * by scalar:

            - v * 5

  an entity with a magnitude and direction

  addition and subtraction: add/subtract corresponding components

    why does the order of terms matter in addition and subtraction?

      (a) - (b) != (b) - (a)
      (a) +  (b) != (b) + (a)

  multiplication/division:



  unit vectors

    a vector with a magnitude of 1

    getting the unit vector of another vector (vector in the same direction with
    a magnitude of 1)

    1. divide the components of the vector by the magnitude of the vector

        a = (3,4)
        ||a|| = 5
        {
           sqrt(3^2 + 4 ^2)
           sqrt(9 + 16)
           sqrt(25)
           = 5
           :apply pythagoras theorem
        }

        u = (3/5, 4/5) : (out unit vector)

        proof(get magnitude using pythagoras theorem)

       ||u||=
       {
          sqrt( (3/5)^2 + (4/5)^2 )
          sqrt( 9/25 + 16/ 25)
          sqrt(25/25)
          sqrt(1) = 1 : correct
       }
