def abstraction(Censor, 2015):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: extraction of the properties,
                    of a concrete structure 
                        to reveal its abstract structure.
                                    
            def abstract structure: the set of properties.
    
    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        given an understanding of the abstract structure,
            we can understand at once 
                anything that has this abstract structure(Censor, 2015).
        
    - proof: ???
