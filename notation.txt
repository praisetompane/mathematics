quantifiers(Kunen, 2007):
    ∀ := for all
    ∃ := there exists
    ∃! := there exists a unique one

    properties:
        - domain of discourse or universe required
            if unspecified, the Real Numbers are implied(Kunen, 2007).
            example:
                ∀x[x² > 4 ⟹ [x > 2 ∨ x < -2]]
                is actually:
                ∀x ∈ ℝ[x² > 4 ⟹ [x > 2 ∨ x < -2]]
        - presumes (Kunen, 2007):
            - functions/operators such as ∧ ∨ > <
                have precise meaning
                    in the domain of discourse
            - objects used such as 2, 4, +-2
                exist
                    in the domain of discourse
    example usage:
        - ∀ := for all:
            for all Real numbers,
                the sum of two Real numbers
                    is a Real number.
                ∀a,b ∈ ℝ, a+b ∈ ℝ
        
        - ∃ := there exists:
            for all Rational numbers
                there exists an inverse.
                ∀a ∈ ℚ, ∃a⁻¹ such that a * a⁻¹ = 1
            
        - ∃! := there exists a unique one         
            every positive Natural numbers
                has a positive square root.
                ∀a ∈ ℕ a > 0, ∃!b s.t. b² = a ∧ b > 0
    NB: often omitted 
        example:
            commutative law: 
                x ⋅ y = y ⋅ x
                is equivalent to
                ∀x,y ∈ ℝ, x ⋅ y = y ⋅ x
 
number sets:
    ℕ := set of natural numbers
    ℤ⁺:= set of positive integers
    ℤ := set of integers
    ℝ := Real Numbers
    ℚ := Rational Numbers

∴        := therefore
ⁿ√x      := nᵗʰ root of x

constructors:
    {}       := Set
    ...      := infinite, with same pattern
    :=       := assignment

propositional connectives:
    ∧       := and
    ∨       := or
    ¬       : not | negation
    ⟹       : implies
        y ⟹ x is always equivalent to ¬y ∨ x
    ⟺       : if and only if

    truth table:

logical operators:
    > greater than
    < less than
    = equal
    ≥ greater than or equal
    ≤ less than or equal

set operators:
    \   := minus
    ∪   := addition
    ∈   := in (is element of)
