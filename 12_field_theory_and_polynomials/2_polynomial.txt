def polynomial(Wildberger, 2014):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: an arithmetic expression consisting of powers of an unknown with coefficients.
      see: 00_numbers/0_number_systems/0_decimal_number_system/0_complex_numbers/0_real_numbers/real_number_arithmetic/2_multiplication/1_exponent.txt

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - types:
            - 1 term = monomial
            - 2 terms = binomial
            - 3 terms = trinomial
            - higher number of terms

            - 1 term = monomial
                Examples:
                    7
                    4𝑥²
                    5𝑥𝑦⁴
            - 2 terms = binomial
                Examples:
                    4𝑥 - 7
                    3𝑥𝑦 + 4𝑥
            - 3 terms = trinomial
                Examples:
                    3 + 𝑎 + 𝑏
                    3𝑐𝑑 + 𝑎 + 8
            - higher number of terms
                Examples:
                    8𝑥 + 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐
                    9𝑦 - 𝑎 - 𝑏  + 𝑐 + 𝑥²
