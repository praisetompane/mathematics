def polynomial(Wildberger, 2014):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: an arithmetic expression consisting of
                        powers of unknowns/variables
                            with coefficients.

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - degree: maximum/highest exponent/power of a term in the polynomial.
            - for multi-variible terms, the degree is the sum of each variable's exponent/power:
                - example:
                    given:
                        𝑝: (𝑥,𝑦) = 5𝑥𝑦⁴
                    then:
                        degree(𝑝) = 1 + 4
                                  = 5
        - roots|zeros: values of the unknowns/variables that make the
                            polynomial's expression equal zero.
            - example:
                1.
                    let:
                        𝑝(𝑥) = 2𝑥 + 4
                    then:
                        𝑥 = -2 is a root
                2.
                    let:
                        𝑝(𝑥,𝑦) = 5𝑥𝑦⁴
                    then:
                        𝑥 = 0 is a root
                        𝑦 = 0 is a root

        - factorization: ???
            - a polynomial of degree 𝑛, has at most 𝑛 factors ???

        - types:
            - based on terms:
                - 1 term = monomial
                    - examples:
                        - 7
                        - 4𝑥²
                        - 5𝑥𝑦⁴

                - 2 terms = binomial
                    - examples:
                        4𝑥 - 7
                        3𝑥𝑦 + 4𝑥

                - 3 terms = trinomial
                    - examples:
                        3 + 𝑎 + 𝑏
                        3𝑐𝑑 + 𝑎 + 8

                - higher number of terms
                    - examples:
                        8𝑥 + 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐
                        9𝑦 - 𝑎 - 𝑏  + 𝑐 + 𝑥²
                - ...

            - based on degree:
                - constant polynomial:
                    - example:
                        - 𝑝(𝑥) = 3𝑥⁰
                               = 3

                - linear polynomial:
                    - example:
                        - 𝑝(𝑥) = 4 - 21𝑥

                - quadratic polynomial:
                    - example:
                        - 𝑝(𝑥) = 2𝑥² + 5𝑥 + 3

                - cubic polynomial:
                    - example:
                        - 𝑝(𝑥) = 6𝑥³ - 1

    - examples:
        - 𝑝(𝑥) = 3
        - 𝑝(𝑥) = 𝑥 + 4𝑥 + 1
        - 𝑝(𝑥,𝑦) = 𝑥² + 5𝑥𝑦
        - 𝑝(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧) = 𝑥⁵ + 10𝑦 - 90 + 𝑧
        - ...
