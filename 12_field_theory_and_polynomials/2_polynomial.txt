def polynomial: 
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english:
        algebraic expression with more than one term.
        poly = many
        nomial = part(Terms in the context of algebraic expressions)

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - types:
            - 1 term = monomial
            - 2 terms = binomial
            - 3 terms = trinomial
            - higher number of terms

            - 1 term = monomial
                Examples:
                    7
                    4𝑥² 
                    5𝑥𝑦⁴
            - 2 terms = binomial
                Examples:
                    4𝑥 - 7
                    3𝑥𝑦 + 4𝑥
            - 3 terms = trinomial
                Examples:
                    3 + 𝑎 + 𝑏
                    3𝑐𝑑 + 𝑎 + 8
            - higher number of terms
                Examples:
                    8𝑥 + 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐
                    9𝑦 - 𝑎 - 𝑏  + 𝑐 + 𝑥²
