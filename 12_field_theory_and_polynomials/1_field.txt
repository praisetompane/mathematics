def field¹(Censor, 2015):
    - formal:
        - axioms (Censor, 2015):
            F with respect to addition (F, +) is a commutative group.
            F with respect to multiplication (F, ×) is a commutative group.
            + and × are related by distributivity

            (F, +) satisfies:
                axiom 1: closure: ∀ab ∈ F, a+b ∈ F
                axiom 2: associativity: ∀abc ∈ F, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
                axiom 3: identity: ∃0 ∈ F such that ∀a ∈ F, a + 0 = a
                axiom 4: inverse: ∀a ∈ F, ∃(-a) ∈ F such that a + (-a) = 0 = identity
                axiom 5: commutativity: ∀ab ∈ F, a+b = b+a

            (F, ×) satisfies:
                axiom 6: closure: ∀ab ∈ F, a×b ∈ F
                axiom 7: associativity: ∀abc ∈ F, (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)
                axiom 8: identity: ∃1 ∈ F such that  ∀a ∈ F, a × 1 = a
                axiom 9: inverse: ∀a ∈ F, a≠0, ∃a⁻¹ ∈ F such that a × a⁻¹ = 1 = identity
                axiom 10: commutativity: ∀ab ∈ F, a × b = b × a

            + and × are distributive:
                (11) ∀abc ∈ F, a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c)

        - in words: a set F with two operations + and ×,  (F, +, ×), is a field if it satisfies the axioms below:

    - properties:
        - special Fields (Censor, 2015):
            - a set with one element is a field.
                example: {0} is a Field.
                NB: it has no interesting characteristics.
                    Therefore the convention in Mathematics is
                        the Set must have at least two different elements
                            playing the role of zero and one
                        to be considered a Field.

            - Zₙ(Finite Fields):
                - Fields with finite members(n).
                    - n is prime
                        i.e. number of members is prime.
                            NB: There exists ones which this is False.
                - + and × are called
                    addition modulo n
                    multiplication modulo n
                    example:
                        Z₅: Z sub 5
                            - addition modulo 5
                            - multiplication modulo 5

    - examples:
        - (ℝ, +, ×) = The Real Numbers with respect to addition and multiplication.
        - (ℂ, +, ×) = The Complex Numbers with respect to addition and multiplication.
        - (ℚ, +, ×) = The Rational Numbers with respect to addition and multiplication.

    - use cases:
        - represent/model the Rational numbers.
        - represent/model the Real numbers.
        - represent/model the Complex numbers.
