def (Censor, 2015):
    formal:
        0 is unique, 1 is unique
    plain english:
        there can only be one value
            playing the role of zero (i.e. additive identity).
proof:
    concise (Censor, 2015):
        suppose there are two zero elements: 0 and 0^.

        axiom      by identity    by commutativity  by identity
                0^ = 0^ + 0       = 0 + 0^          = 0

                0^ = 0
                ∴ 0 is unique

    plain english:
        suppose there are two zero elements: 0 and 0^.

        i.e. two elements playing the zero role(the additive identity).

        then:
            for '0' playing zero role:
                        add 0 to 0^

                axiom           by additive identity axiom
                        0^ + 0 = 0^

            for '0^' playing zero role:
                        add 0^ to 0

                axiom           by additive identity axiom
                        0 + 0^ = 0

            both equations above are equal

                axiom           by commutativity axiom
                        0^ + 0 = 0 + 0^

            ∴ 0^ = 0

            i.e. the same, therefore can only be one zero.

            Question: Why is it sufficient to use only two zero elements?
