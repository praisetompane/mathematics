def (Censor, 2015):
    formal:
        a × 0 = 0
proof:
    apply identity axiom with respect to addition(+) to 0 in 𝑎 × 0 = 0:
        then
            𝑎 × 0 = 0 rewrites to 𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0 + 0

    apply identity axiom with respect to addition(+) to 0 + 0 on RHS:
        then
            𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0 + 0 rewrites to 𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0

    Then
        𝑎 × 0 = 0 AND 𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 0
        ∴ 𝑎 × 0 = 𝑎 × (0 + 0)
            NB: since they both equal 0

    apply distributive axiom to 𝑎 × (0 + 0):
        then
            𝑎 × (0 + 0) = 𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0
        ∴ 𝑎 × 0 = 𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0

    apply additive inverse axiom to 𝑎 × 0:
        then
            𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 0
                ∴ additive inverse is -(𝑎 × 0)
        then
            rewrite 𝑎 × 0 in 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) to (𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0) [because after applying distributive axiom we showed this is true]
                ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = (𝑎 × 0 + 𝑎 × 0) + (-(𝑎 × 0))

    apply associativity with respect to addition(+) to RHS
        ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 𝑎 × 0 + (𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)))

    apply number + its inverse = 0 to LHS and RHS
        apply to RHS (𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0))):
            ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 𝑎 × 0 + 0
            ∴ 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)) = 𝑎 × 0

        apply to LHS 𝑎 × 0 + (-(𝑎 × 0)):
            ∴ 0  = 𝑎 × 0

    Then
        0  = 𝑎 × 0 ⟹ 𝑎 × 0 = 0
