def terms: parts of an algebraic expression, operated on by + or-.(Question: only + or -?)
    Examples:
        4𝑥𝑧  + 3𝑥  - 3 has 3 terms
        4𝑥³𝑦 - 3𝑦²     has 2 terms

def polynomial: 
    algebraic expression with more than one term.
    poly = many
    nomial = part(Terms in the context of algebraic expressions)

    types:
        - 1 term = monomial
        - 2 terms = binomial
        - 3 terms = trinomial
        - higher number of terms

        - 1 term = monomial
            Examples:
                7
                4𝑥² 
                5𝑥𝑦⁴
        - 2 terms = binomial
            Examples:
                4𝑥 - 7
                3𝑥𝑦 + 4𝑥
        - 3 terms = trinomial
            Examples:
                3 + 𝑎 + 𝑏
                3𝑐𝑑 + 𝑎 + 8
        - higher number of terms
            Examples:
                8𝑥 + 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐
                9𝑦 - 𝑎 - 𝑏  + 𝑐 + 𝑥²
