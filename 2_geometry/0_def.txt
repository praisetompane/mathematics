def geometry: the study of the intrinsic shapes of mathematical objects (Frenkel).

def Cartesian: anything that derives from René Descartes' conception of Geometry (Stover, Christopher and Weisstein, Eric W).
               Geometry conceptualized as points/vector represented as an ordered tuple of real numbers(i.e. Cartesian coordinates)
                    The plane is represented as below(called a Cartesian product of sets) (Stover, Christopher and Weisstein):
                        R² = IR x IR => 2D space
                        IR³ = IR x IR x IR => Euclidian space
                        .
                        .
                        .

                    ordered pair of reals/Cartesian coordinates(Stover, Christopher and Weisstein, Eric W).:
                        Cartesian coordinates are rectilinear coordinates 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional(also known as Rectangular coordinates).
                            (x,y) => {(-1, 0), (23, -34), (99,34),...} => IR² 
                                - known as point or 2-vector

                            (x,y,z) => {(3, 7, -3), (-4, 56, -2), (78,-3,-5),...} => IR³ 
                                - known as point or 3-vector
                        AND spacial case of curvilinear coordinates⁵
