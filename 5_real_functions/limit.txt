def limit(Censor, 2013):
    formal:
            lim     𝑓(𝑥) = L if
            𝑥->𝑎 
                ∀ϵ>0 ∃δ>0 s.t 
                0 < |𝑥 - 𝑎| < δ ⟹ |𝑓(𝑥) - L| < ϵ
            
        in words:
            the limit as 𝑥 approaches 𝑎
                for 𝑓(𝑥) equals L 
                    if
                        for all epsilon(ϵ) greater than zero(0)
                            there e𝑥ists delta(δ) greater than zero(0)
                                such that
                                    the absolute difference of 𝑥 and 𝑎 is greater than zero(0) AND less than delta(δ)
                                        implies
                                            the absolute difference of 𝑓(𝑥) and L is less than epsilon(ϵ)
            
    plain english:
        the limit as 𝑥 approaches 𝑎 for 𝑓(𝑥) equals L
        implies the absolute difference of 𝑓(𝑥) and L is less epsilon(ϵ)
            if 
                for all epsilon(ϵ) greater than zero(0)
                    there e𝑥ists a delta(δ) greater than zero(0)
                        such that the absolute difference of 𝑥 and 𝑎 is greater than zero(0) and less than delta(δ)
        NB: double check this description later
